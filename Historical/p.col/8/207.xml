I'd remove editorial punctuation in light of the scribal one and lack of continuous syntax. Remove dittography in i.5; reverse order of items in |reg| tags in i.14, i.16, ii.18, ii.25, ii.30, ii.33; encode marginal traces printed below col. i; redo line numbering of col. ii and iii to follow edition; add scribal point at end of ii.21; typo in ii.22; dot lambda in ii.34; dots in ii.35; dot sigma in ii.37; use lost.1lin passim in col. iii. Review all metadata before finalization.</change>

VIII publication, and checked alongside the ed. pr. of Feinberg as part of the Lodge Papyrology Fellowship, Columbia University. The editor in P. Col. indicates some additional text has been inserted from the document on the back (P. Col. VIII.222), but did not include it in their version so I do not know what it was suppose to be, nor I could not make anything out from the papyrus image. I have not included notes on tetragram symbol variation from Milne since this information is in the ed. pr. and supplemented by the P. Col. commentary.</change>

VIII doesn't include anything not on the papyrus, Feinberg 1972 supplies the missing words for after line 17, as well as the equivalent of Milne's 86 and 87. Should I include these since Feinberg is the ed. pr.?</change>
