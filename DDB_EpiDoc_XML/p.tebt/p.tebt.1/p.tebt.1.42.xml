Clarysse (mail from 10.02.2015) "I can see -σισουχος instead of -θισουχος : the theta is normally larger and not so circular (more vertical), the sigma needs a dot, but is not unlike that in βασιλικου in l.4, written in two strokes. The probem is the preceding epsilon.  I thought at first to read Μαρησισουχος : after all the name is Μαρ(ρ)ης. But all his etas have the capital high rising form H, never the cursive form, which would fit here. I donot know : the identification with Marresisouchos must be right, but what letter was written there escapes me."</change>

The wavy crossbar of epsilon is similar to that of the second epsilon in ἱερέως in the same line; it extends into the subsequent sigma, giving the illusion of an epsilon instead of a sigma before iota.  In my opinion, the problem with Μαρσεισούχου is that it presumes an unusual form for sigma after rho: one would expect to see the lower part of this purported sigma, which would also be atypical for having a top stroke that starts very low, almost on the baseline.</change>
