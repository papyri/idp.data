               <milestone n="1" unit="line"/> fugitives. On receiving the present letter, therefore …
                      six men of those whose duty it is to … such …, dealing with
                      such of them as have fled to each pagarchy in accordance with the
                      instructions which we have laid down for you at the foot of the present
                      letter, sending to them (i. e. the fugitives) men (lit. someone) who are
                      capable and trustworthy and able to write, with instructions to proceed
                      with them to the commissioners for the fugitives, and to take down in
                      their presence the name and patronymic of each, stating also from what
                      place each fled and to what place and what pagarchy, both in the case
                      of those who are being sent back to their homes and in the case of those
                      who are allowed to remain where they settled on condition of contributing
                      (to the taxes); <milestone n="12" unit="line"/> in short, they are to discover all that is to be
                      known. Order them to set about their work energetically and not to
                      receive from anyone anything whatever by way of gratuity; for you
                      will be aware that if anyone of the persons you send is convicted of
                      having received a gratuity from anyone whatsoever, the danger is
                      yours and you will receive punishment along with the guilty person.
                      But send off the said men promptly to the aforementioned commissioners
                      for the fugitives, and let me not find you guilty of causing any
                      impediment to this or of delaying the despatch of the full number
                      which we have written to you, lest you fall into danger. Written
