               <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 1</note> Dionysia, daughter of Chaeremon, with her guardian who is her son Apion also called Dionysius, son of Diogenes, both of Oxyrhynchus, has leased to Psenamounis, son of Thonis and Seoëris, from Paberke in the eastern toparchy, a Persian of the Epigone, for six years dating from the present sixth year of our sovereign Antoninus Caesar, 38 arourae belonging to her and previously cultivated by Psenamounis under another lease, on these conditions. For the first five years fixed by the agreement the lessee may sow and gather whatever crops he chooses with the exception of woad and coriander(?); in the last year he shall sow and gather the same crops as those appointed for him in the last year of the previous lease. The rent of the whole leasehold during the six years is fixed at 190 artabae of wheat a year and a money-payment of 12 drachmae a year, which shall all be free of every risk, the land-tax being paid by the lessor, who shall also be the owner of the crops until the rent is paid. If in any of the years there should be a failure of water, an allowance shall be made to the lessee. He shall also, when the lease is guaranteed to him, measure into the public granary from the amount fixed as the rent for the year the yearly corn tax on the buildings, at his own expense, and he shall pay this deposit to the lessor free of all adulteration every year at the time of the first measuring, an equivalent allowance being made to him. The remainder of the yearly rent together with the money-payment he shall always pay to the lessor in the month of Payni at the granary of Paberke, new, clean, unadulterated, sifted wheat, with no barley in it, similar to that which is delivered at the public granary, measured by the bronze-rimmed measure containing four choenices used for payments to the lessor or her agents. Any arrears owed by the lessee shall be paid with the addition of half their amount. The lessor shall have the right of execution upon both the person and all the property of the lessee, and the lessor shall not be permitted to let the property to any one else or to cultivate it herself within the six years. This lease is valid. The sixth year of the Emperor Caesar Titus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus Pius, Phaophi 5.
               I, Psenamounis, son of Thonis, have taken the land on lease for the six years at a yearly rental of 190 artabae of wheat and a money-payment of 12 drachmae, and I will make all the payments aforesaid. I, Theon, son of Theon and Ophelia, signed for him, as he is illiterate, on the same date.
