              To Heraclides, priest, chief justice, superintendent of the chrematistae and the other courts, from Syra, daughter of Theon. I married Sarapion, bringing him by cession a dowry amounting to 200 drachmae of silver. As he was destitute of means I received him into my parents’ house, and I for my part conducted myself blamelessly in all respects. But Sarapion, having squandered my dowry as he pleased, continually ill-treated and insulted me, using violence towards me, and depriving me of the necessaries of life; finally he deserted me leaving me in a state of destitution. I therefore beg you to order him to be brought before you, in order that he may be compelled perforce to pay back my dowry increased by half its amount. This petition is without prejudice to any other claims which I have or may have against him.
