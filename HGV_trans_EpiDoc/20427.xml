              <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 4</note>
              To ..., son of Isidorus the ex-exegetes, late strategus of the city, priest, archidicastes and superintendent of the chrematistae and the other courts, through the deputy archidicastes Demetrius son of Heraclides the ex-exegetes, from Gaius Marcius Apion also called Diogenes and Gaius Marcius Apolinarius also called Julianus and however we are styled, and from Ophelas son of Ophelas, of Oxyrhynchus. Gaius Marcius Apion also called Diogenes and Gaius Marcius Apolinarius also called Julianus, being at present unable to make the voyage to Egypt, agree that they have appointed the aforesaid Ophelas, who is the agent for their property in the Oxyrhynchite nome, by the terms of the present authorization to act for and take charge of their brother’s children Valerius Theodotus also called Polion and Valeria Apollonarion also called Nicarete, who are minors and their wards, and further to collect rents and to make such leases as may be necessary, and to appear against persons and to sell off produce as may be needful on his own authority. Accordingly let those concerned do business with Ophelas in the discharge of all the aforesaid duties; and he shall forward to the said parties accounts of all his acts every month, and shall have power to act in all things no less than they themselves would have if present. Ophelas the appointed representative assents to this authorization;
              and all bonds of every kind which Apion also called Diogenes and Apolinarius also called Julianus hold of each other remains in force. We request (your concurrence). The 17th year of the Emperor Caesar Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus Pius, Mecheir 2.
