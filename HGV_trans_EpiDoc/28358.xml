              A to B, greeting. To-day I appointed you by a public deed drawn up through the record-office here as my representative to collect from Gaius Memmius Cornutus also called Polydeuces, who is at Alexandria, my share of the sums owed by him to my said father’s heir, his nephew Heraclides also called Amoitas, but it happens that I have been paid the debt in full. I acknowledge that the contract of representation has been made with you for the sole purpose of your issuing a receipt to the officials without receiving anything, and for cancelling the mortgage, because I have, as aforesaid, already received the money as stated in the autograph receipts which I have issued, and I make no claim on any matter whatever.
            </p>
