              Marcus to his dearest Matreas, greeting. About the fleeces, since you offered to buy some good ones, adding that the summer ones were the best, I bade you buy them whenever they were good, and I wrote to you that they had not brought any to me up to Mesore, and you afterwards wrote and said you had bought some and sold them again, and ... you wrote me a letter, and I was never ...; I will send you the very letter by Syrus in order that you may read it in a sober mood and be self-condemned. If it 1s troublesome and you have not yet bought them, give the money to my friend Zoilus; if however you have bought them, deliver them to him under scal, in order that they may be conveyed tome. Good-bye. <note>Date, and address on the verso.</note>
