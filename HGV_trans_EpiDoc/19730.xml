<milestone n="2" rend="break" unit="line"/> ⳨ In the fourth year of the reign and consulship of our divinissimus lord Flavius Justin the eternal Augustus Emperor, eighth Phaophi of the third indiction in the 
most glorious Antinoopolis.
<milestone n="6" rend="break" unit="line"/> † On the one part Aurelius Theodoros, son of Georgios, from the mother Nonna, hired baker, hailing from the fair city of Antinoopolis, 
<milestone n="12" rend="break" unit="line"/> and on the other part Aurelia Amaresia, 
daughter of Proous, the trader, of the mother Fania, hailing from the same city, conclude and make jointly this written agreement of divorce and separation,

nor concerning any matter in general, <milestone n="28" unit="line"/> but also that I, the aforementioned Theodoros give up for the kids (we had) so far together with the baby in the womb …
