              <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 9</note>
              To his highness Aurelius Severus, deputy-epistrategus, from Aurelius Ptolemaeus son of Sempronius son of Lucius, his mother being Thaësis, of the city of Oxyrhynchus. It is the custom since we gained by the gift of our lords Severus and the great Antoninus the contest of the ephebi that those who are for the time being amphodogrammateis of the city should, as the contest of each year approaches, submit and publish a list of those about to become ephebi, in order that each one may assume the status of ephebus at the proper season. Since then the present amphodogrammateus of the city, Aurelius Sarapion, in the list recently published by him of those who are auspiciously about to become ephebi, has, perhaps in ignorance, passed over my son who is also an incipient ephebus and on the roll of our gymnasium, and who reached the age of 14 years in the 25th year, and was passed in accordance with his age and parentage into the list of the members of the gymnasium in the same 25th year, I perforce have recourse to you, requesting that my son too may be entered in the list of the ephebi in the same way as his companions, that so I may obtain relief. Farewell.
              I, Aurelius Ptolemaeus, presented the petition.
