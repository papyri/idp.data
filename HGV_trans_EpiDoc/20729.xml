               <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 1</note> ...they broke down a door that led into the public street and had been blocked up with bricks, probably using a log of wood as a battering-ram. They then entered the house and contented themselves with taking from what was stored there 10 artabae of barley, which they carried off by the same way. We guessed that this was removed piecemeal by the said door from the marks of a rope dragged along in that direction, and pointed out this fact to the chief of the police of the village and to the other officials. I am therefore obliged to put in this petition, and beg you to order that the chief of the police and the other officials be brought before you, and to make due inquiry about the robbery, so that I may be able to recover the barley.
