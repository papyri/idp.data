               <milestone n="1" unit="line"/> … and neglect to send out to us the sailors who were requisitioned
                      from your administrative district for the carabi and dromonaria
                      and other ships of the raiding fleet of Egypt in the 8th
                      indiction, we have instructed Hayyān b. Shuraih to hire those with
                      whom you are in arrear in accordance with the rate (of wages) stated
                      in our demand notes. <milestone n="7" unit="line"/> On receiving the present letter, therefore, send
                      with all speed, in accordance with the account enclosed with the present
                      letter, the money for their wages, not keeping back one single solidus
                      of it. <milestone n="11" unit="line"/> For indeed we know that it is no concern to you nor yet to the
                      people of your district to carry out or perform any sort of duty, unless
                      you are importuned for the arrears in your payments, except in accordance
                      with the instructions contained in our demand notes. But we
                      will not allow this to be so; for we shall not treat the capable and
                      efficient man who zealously performs his duty in the same way as him
                      who through corruption falls short in the tasks entrusted to him by us.
                      <milestone n="21" unit="line"/> Therefore if you have any sense perform the command given by our
                      letter, not sending any of these moneys negligently but discharging
                      your duty zealously. <milestone n="24" unit="line"/> Written the 13th Thoth, 8th indiction.
