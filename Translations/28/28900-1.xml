I (fetched?) seven cheeses; the sailor (said) that the (rest?) had been eaten by mice. Since you wrote that you have not received (neither the...) nor the cheeses whole ... for this reason ...not to give him for ... (Two and a half severely damaged lines). ...to be here, as (he?) is needed.  He writes blaming me ...not to be blamed at another time... Urge Serenos to come (to us?) as swiftly as possible for we are in need of him and, when he comes, he (will be like a star?) rising. Greet your mother and (brothers?), Homonoia and Demetrion. Greetings from Agathous, Eisarous and ... I wish you well.;Verso:;To Theon from Zena(rion?);(2nd hand in the opposite direction):  ...the one who held the office of the kosmetes in  Oxyrhynchos</ab>
