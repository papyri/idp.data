            <ab>. . . Pharmouthi 15.;Dorion to Serenus, his sweetest son, greeting. Before all I pray for your health and perform the act of obeisance for you in the presence of our ancestral gods, praying for what is best on your behalf. A short time ago I sent you by Theon a palm-leaf basket of bread and a basket in which were cheeses and parsley-root, as your letter includes. Write me, sir, together with the rest about your well-being and about the things which you want from me. Give salutations from me to the sweetest Isidoros; your mother Thais sends you salutations as do also your brother Herakles and your sister Antonia, also called Modesta, and all who are in the house. I pray for your welfare, my lord son, Pharmouthi 12.;(Post-script, in the left margin:) In regard to the old farm-building belonging to the house, Iulius anticipated [me] in writing to you that Eutyches is causing us trouble.;;(Verso);;To Serenus, his son, from Dorion, his father.</ab>
