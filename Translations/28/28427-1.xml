            <ab>Thenpetsokis to her sister Thenapunchis, very many greetings. Before all else I pray for the health of yourself and your children and Pasis the koruphos (?). I sent you by Protas 50 dried figs. Had it not been for the fact that I was ill, I should have sent them to you long ago; but if my health is good I will send a kotyle of orris-root for your daughter. Give Tephersais the loom, the bed, the � of the reeds for weaving, the �, the thuia-wood, the two cakes, the boxes of papers, the little �, the can, the lampstand, the little basket with its contents at the bottom, the feeding-bottle (?), and the big case. Let Kotus give to Tephersais the box which I lent him, for it does not belong to your uncle. I salute you and your brothers. Also let the daughter of Kephalas give the measure to Tephersais, and let her sell it and send me the money, since I am coming. I salute Aphrodite our mother. The trough belong to Agathangelos, so let it be given to the children. Tell the wife of the tinman, Ameimon, with regard to your son, that she is to give him the wooden stool, the little door, and the small trough (?). (Postscript added in the upper margin) Receive from Tephersais 50 dried figs. (Addressed on the verso) Deliver to Thenapunchis, the wife of the potter.</ab>
