            <ab>Extract from a rescript of the deified Hadrian. The 6th year of Hadrianus Caesar the Lord, Hathyr 17, Apollonides against Claudius Antoninus. After other evidence Aelius Hadrianus (wrote): "Only yesterday I declared to you that my edict was of service to you, and I think that Philotera, being an excellent person whose good character is well known to me, will do you no wrong, especially as (she?) knows that unjust possession is invalid; but you still wish to trouble me about points which are not at issue, although you have the guardian of the lender who shall restore to you the slaves." Flavius Juncinus said: "In accordance with the rescripts of our lord Apollonides shall receive back the slaves and their labor from Antoninus, the heir." Julius Theon, a victor in the sacred games and exempt from taxation, neokoros of the great Sarapis, ex-archidikastes, priest, and hypomnematographos, said: " � Since Ptolema has the � as the result of the contracts of sale, and of the declaration of the chief engineers and of my own personal observation, the house belongs to Ptolema. For there is no need to inquire into the possession, as we are bound to respect the rescripts of the deified Trajan and our lord Hadrianus Caesar Augustus which have been read."</ab>
