            <ab>To Mamertinus also called Herakleides and his sister Besous through the aforesaid Herakleides, from Dionusios son of Heron, of the village of Kerkesoucha Orous in the division of Polemon. I wish to lease from you the two thirds share of a catoecic holding of five arouras which belongs to you, undivided, in common with your other sister Isidora also called Didume, for four years from the present 19th year, to be sown in the first and third year with grass, at an annual rent of 28 drachmas of silver, without allowance for seed; and in the second and fourth years to be sown with barley, at an annual rent, including 3 1/3 artabas of barley which I shall receive for seed, of 24 artabas of barley altogether, subject to no charge or risk. And I will perform all the proper annual operations at my own expense, doing no damage, and I will pay the rent in produce in the month Pauni at the threshing-floor of the holding, using your own four-choinix measure, the measuring to be done through some representative of yours; and the rent in money I will pay in the month Phamenoth, the yearly transport charges for the expedition of grain to be borne by me, and delivery of the produce by you. And at the end of the period I will surrender the arouras free from rushes, coarse grass and dirt of every kind, if you consent to the lease. Dionusios, aged about 43, with a scar on his right wrist. The 19th year of Lucius Septimius Severus and Marcus Aurelius Antoninus and Publius Septimius Geta Pii Augusti, Thoth 5.</ab>
