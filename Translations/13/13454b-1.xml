            <ab>(28-36) Likewise Thenpakebkis daughter of Psoiphis and Thenpakebkis was registered together with � in the house to house census for the 9th year as a priestess at the age of 38, in the 16th year of the deified Hadrianus at the age of 24, and in the 2nd year of the deified Hadrianus together with her father as a member of the priestly order at the age of 10. This is the evidence submitted concerning parentage; and to show that permission was given for circumcision they submitted a copy of a minute of Flavius Melas, ex-high-priest, dated Pharmouthi 25 of the 13th year. After this had been read Serenianus said:--You have proved yourself to be of priestly family. (40-53) Marsisouchos son of Mar� and Thenkebkis, having given proof of a knowledge of hieratic and Egyptian writing from a hieratic book produced by the sacred scribes in accordance with the memorandum of the 12th of the month Tybi of the present 2nd year, and Pakebkis also called Zosimus, son of Pakebkis and Thaisas, on the strength of proofs produced concerning parentage, were respectively shown to be of priestly family. I pray for your health. The 2nd year of Imperator Caesar Lucius Aurelius Verus Augustus, Mecheir 12.</ab>
