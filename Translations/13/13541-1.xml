            <ab>The twentieth year of Imperator Caesar Nerva Trajanus Augustus Germanicus Dacicus Parthicus, Mesore �, at Tebtunis in the division of Polemon of the Arsinoite nome. Tephersais daughter of Herakleos the elder, son of N.N., aged about [.]7, having a scar on her neck to the left, with her guardian her brother Herakleos, aged about �, has apprenticed her son Kronion son of Kronion son of Areios to Heron son of Orseus, weaver, aged about 27, having a scar in the middle of his forehead, that he may learn the aforesaid trade of weaving in its entirety, as Heron himself knows it, for two years dating from the 1st of the month Sebastos of the coming 21st year, the boy being fed by his mother, to whom the said Heron shall give each month on account of food 4 drachmas, the said Heron clothing the boy and also being responsible for the State dues upon him during the two years. Tephersais has received from Heron out of the 46 drachmas agreed upon for the whole period 14 drachmas and she will obtain in the month Sebastos of the coming year 12 drachmas, and in the month Sebastos of the 22nd year the remaining 20 drachmas. At the end of the period Heron shall deliver up the boy knowing the trade in its entirety, and shall give him on his departure �, but for every day that (the boy does not work he shall forfeit) 1 drachma ... (2nd hand) I, Heron son of Orseus, shall instruct the child � and I will do each thing as stated above. Marepsemis son of N.N. has written for him because he does not know letters. (3rd hand) I, Tephersais daughter of Herakleos, with Herakleos as my guardian, have apprenticed my son. (Traces of four more lines: presumably date and registration note).</ab>
