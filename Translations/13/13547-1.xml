            <ab>We, Herakles and Athenodoros and Heron and Zoilos, all four collectors of the poll-tax at the village of Tebtunis, agree voluntarily and of our own free will that we have made a division for the fifteenth of the month Hathyr, of which the receipts are credited to Phaophi, of the third year of Trajanus Caesar the Lord for the present third year only of Imperator Caesar Nerva Trajanus Augustus Germanicus, and that Athenodoros and Herakles have been allotted the inhabitants and settlers in the village, while Heron and Zoilos have for their part been allotted all the inhabitants and settlers (of Tebtunis) at other villages or in the metropolis, on condition that those who have been allotted the external district shall pay each month 1100 drachmas of silver, while those who have been allotted the village shall make up the monthly balance of the quota for the poll-tax, being also responsible for the salary of the sword-bearer. If any of us four violates any of the aforesaid provisions, he shall pay to the party abiding by them 500 drachmas and to the Treasury an equal sum. This bond shall be valid, as if it had been publicly registered. The coming extra levy of the present third year shall be demanded by them from the classes of persons which they have severally been allotted. The third year of Imperator Caesar Nerva Trajanus Augustus Germanicus [Hathyr ..].</ab>
