Several years ago, my lord, I was united in marriage to Hermes son of N.N., of the village of Theogonis, during the lifetime of my parents, and brought him on (the occasion of) the marriage, in accordance with the contract made between us, a dowry amounting to 5000 drachmas. I have also had two children by him and have no thought of another man (?). But he, after my parents' death carried off all that was left me by them, and took it to his house at Theogonis and is using it up. (�) (3rd hand) I, Herakleia daughter of Didumos, have submitted (this petition). (2nd hand?) The 9th year of Lucius Septimius Severus Pius Pertinax Arabicus Adiabenicus Parthicus Optimus and Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Pius Augusti (month, day).</ab>
