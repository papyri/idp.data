Petesouchos son of Onnophris, an inhabitant of Tali and a Persian of the Epigone, aged about 45 years, having a scar on the little finger of his left hand, acknowledges to Zoilos son of Harmiusis, aged about 48 years, having a scar on the right forearm, that he has received from him, Zoilos, from hand to hand out of the house a loan of 1 1/6 artabas of wheat, new, pure, and unadulterated, and 8 drachmas of silver, and 1/3 artaba of lentils measured by the six-choinix measure of Tali; and the acknowledging party is under obligation to repay Zoilos all the aforesaid in the month Pauni of the current 2nd year without any delay or excuse, Zoilus having the right of execution both upon him and upon all his property. The subscriber is Lusimachos son of Kronion, aged about 58, having a scar on the little finger of the left hand. (2nd hand) I, Petesouchos son of Onnophris, one of the (inhabitants) from Tali, acknowledge that I have received from Zoilos son of Harmiusis a loan of 1 1/6 artabas of wheat measured by the six-choinix measure of Theogonis and eight silver drachmas and a third artaba of lentils, which I will repay in the month Pauni of the current second year as is written above. Lusimachos son of Kronion has written for him because he does not know letters. (4th hand) I, Zoilos son of Harmiusis; the agreement happened for me as is written above. (5th hand?)
