And I give to him also one third of the furniture and household goods, and of all the sums due me of any kind whatsoever.

Ischyrion, also called Nestnephis, shall also pay all the public taxes in money and in kind on the two arourai, and he shall provide me as long as I live, from the present day annually in the month Drousilleios, on account of food and payments in kind, with twelve artabai of new, pure, and unadulterated wheat, measured in the six-choinix measure of the broker in Talei, and with twelve drachmai of silver annually on account of clothers and oil and expenses; and he shall pay all the public charges in my behalf both for the tax on flute players and the tax on music. And (I acknowledge that) as long as I live, I, Orseus, also called Herodes, shall not have the power to sell any of the aforesaid property or to mortgage it or to give any part of it to any children except the aforesaid. I agree that anything that shall be done illegally by me contrary to these conditions shall be null and void as aforesaid.
