            <ab>To Apollonios, strategos of the Arsinoite nome, from Papontos, son of Papontos, a resident of Talei in the division of Polemon, a farmer of the so-called (allotment) of Psenantis among the residents of Talei in the same division. Whereas certain persons came as robbers into the house which I have in the aforesaid village of Talei and carried off ten wooden beams and a mortar belonging to me, and whereas, while I was making an investigation into the matter in company with the epistates of the village of Talei, I found as evidence of the theft in the house of Patynion, son of Herakles, a part of the stolen beams, five in number, and whereas, while I was arguing with him about these, he insulted me outrageously and in the scuffle a child whom I had on my shoulder fell to the ground in such a manner that it is in danger of its life, I ask you to write to the epistatai of Talei to send the accused Patynion to you for the coming assizes. Farewell.;The eighth year of Claudius, Mecheir 10.;Papontos, about 45 years old, tall, light brown in color, with a scar on the left side of his nose below the eyebrow.</ab>
