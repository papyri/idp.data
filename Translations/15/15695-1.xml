            <ab>Col. i;Copy.;To Vettius Gallanus, the most excellent praefectus montis and acting-epistrategos, from Aurelius Apollonios alias Sarapion, son of Drako, of the Althaean demos, landowner in Piospolis Parva of the Thebaid.;You are aware, greatest of procurators, that the imperial decree transcribed above (the very one indeed that I transcribed above) indicated the unlawful intention of my father, who leaves a will that is ..., but provides guarantees if a son has taken possession of his proper share justly and legally, having also declared it to the local archive of real property. Having come into ownership..., and having paid my share of public dues to the most sacred fiscus, both the amounts owed for customary rents and those needful to the sacred annona, with the consequence that no debts continue to accumulate against me, so that I may have a quiet mind, I know well also your evil-hating concern for those who have been overreached. My father's wife, by name Osaeus, daughter of Philemon, after my father's deification, when she obtained a legacy from an illegal will, having then taken under her control, as was evidents, all contracts of loan regarding household abjects as well as produce and money, of which I compiled the itemized list only with great difficulty and after many searches, has desired to have the sole right of possession with respect to these, having tried from the first to obtain possession of the property and to use it as she may choose ...;Col.  ii;(so that I) may be able to render eternal gratitude (for the benefactions bestowed) by the genius of our undefeated lord and emperor Antoninus and to your just right hand, having obtained in full my legal share of the paternal estate, than which nothing is sweeter to sons. I have appended also a copy of the will.;Year 25, Choiak 29;When you have given due notice to your opponent, you may petition;deliver (this).;From Aurelius Apollonios alias Sarapion, son of Drako</ab>
