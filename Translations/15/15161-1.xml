            <ab>16th year, Pharmouthi 29.;;I, Didyme, daughter of Petesouchos, son of Chambouchis, with my husband Harpouonsis, son of Orseus, as guardian, acknowledge that I have sold to Mares, son of Dionysios, son of Kambouchis, the third part that belongs to me from the fourth part of a three-story house and acourt and all the appurtenances common and undivided, in Talei. The neighbors of the whole house and court are as follow: on the south of the house the house of Petermouthis, son of Orseus, the blacksmith, and on the south of the court the court of Zenon, son of Ptolemaios; on the north the house of Anoubion and of his brother, the fuller; on the west the court of Zenon, son of Ptolemaios; and on the east the royal road. And I have received from Mares the entire sum fixed and agreed upon for the share sold, in full, from hand to hand, out of the house, and I guarantee the sale with every guarantee from all public and private encumbrances and every sort of tax, as aforesaid. Herodes, son of Herodes, wrote for them because they are illiterate. (2nd hand) Marres, son of Dionysios, son of Kambouthis. The sale was made to me as aforesaid. Diodoros, son of Ptolemaios, wrote for him because he is illiterate.</ab>
