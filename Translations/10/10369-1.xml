To Julius Septimius Sabinus censitor from Aurelius Isidorus, son of
Ptolemaeus, of the village of Karanis in the first and sixth toparchy of the Heraclides division of the Arsinoite nome.
In conformity with the imperial edict of our lords the invincible kings Diocletian and Maximian, Augusti, 
and Constantius and Maximian, <milestone unit="line" n="5"/> the        
 most noble Caesars, I declare to you that I possess land in the vicinity of the same village of Karanis 
and that I have ascertained the measurements of the land of my estate in the village. Aphrodisius and Paulinus,
surveyors, measured the areas in the presence of Apollonius, Kopres, and Heron, iuratores; of Syrus, 
assistant to the dekaprotoi of the toparchy; and of Pannous the horiodeiktes, who have appended their signatures.
The parcels are as follows:
In the <milestone unit="line" n="10"/> 18th section, in the hamlet called P[. .]moun, eleven sixteenths
of an aroura of private land sown in the 14th, 13th and 6th year—11/16
ar., of which the adjacent areas are: on the east a canal, beyond which is waste land entirely unowned, 
and on the west the estate of Doulus.

I swear by the Tyche and Victory of our lords the invincible kings that I have made this declaration in accordance with the truth.

13th, and 6th year.
