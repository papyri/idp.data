You must know that Elouras the royal scribe is become deputy for the strategus Erasus, in accordance with a letter of his highness the praefect.  If you think it well, send him an artaba of olives and some fish, as we want to make use of him.  Send us for the house some...and olives, for they have no fresh olives at the house.  Send the...since Erasus is going to celebrate the festival of Harpocrates so soon on the 14th, and send him the cabbages(?).  Load all the animals with cabbage and we will send him five...of cabbage and as much to the house...What you write to me about not neglecting the building you have said more than enough, and you write too often "I am thanking the village," when they have charged you with four staters.  I pray for your perpetual good health.  The 11th year of Trajanus Caesar the lord, Tubi 19. (Grenfell, Hunt, &amp; Hogarth)</ab>
