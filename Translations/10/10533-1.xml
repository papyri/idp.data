            <ab>	In the third consulate of our lords Constantius and Maximianus, most noble Caesars. To Aurelia Thermoutharion, daughter of Sextus, a legionary, who is acting without a guardian by virtue of the ius libet-rum, from Aurelius Isidoros son of Ptolemaios and Herois, from the village of Karanis. I wish to lease from you in partnership on a basis of half-shares the two arouras, or however many there may be, of an olive grove belonging to you in the vicinity of the same village of Karanis, for five years [reckoning] from the fruits of the current sixteenth, fifteenth, and eignth year, which mature in the coming year, it being my obligation to give from my portion each year one artaba of olives by the four-choinix dromos measure. And it  shall not be permissible for me to abandon the lease within the term in any way, and I shall accomplish all the yearly chores, gathering and removal of dry, dead branches, pruning, harrowing, the harvesting being my responsibility as the lessee, and I shall do both plowing and irrigating, and we shall divide the harvests in half-shares, all public charges resting on you, the owner; and on the expiration of the term I will surrender the olive grove having had as I also received it, if you agree to make the lease. And when the formal question was put to me, I made acknowledgment. I, Aurelia Thermoutharion, have made the lease on half-shares, as stated above. I, Aurelius Mikkalos, have written on her behalf, since she is illiterate. Year 16-15-8 of our lords Diocletian and Maximian, Augusti, and Constantius and Maximianus, the most noble Caesars, Mecheir 10.
