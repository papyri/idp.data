            <ab>Aurelius Sarapion to Polion his brother and Diogenes his father, very many greetings. You know that I am blameless, and you went away from me for no reason without giving me money. I bought two rolls of papyrus for the lists of the grain-dues (?) of the Basilikos Grammateus, and paid another 28 drachmas to the Basilikos Grammateus himself for the agreement concerning the unirrigated land. Therefore regarding this as a necessity use your best endeavors and send me my 52 drachmas and collect on my account 60 drachmas besides; for since I am in need give me a little help (?). Assuredly, therefore, good brother Polion, remember me, and what I also have done for you from beginning to end, and I will serve you again. Urge my brother to come to you for the barley, and inform Diogenes, that he also may give an artaba of barley on account of wages. So give me your help, that (the barley) may of necessity be pulled up (?), for I have been shut up in the finance-office until today, and be sure to let me know what you have done about me. I pray for your health.</ab>
