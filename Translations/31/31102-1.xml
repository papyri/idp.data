            <ab>To Aurelius Alexander, of the police magistrates, from Aurelius A[---] alias Aphynchis, former exhibitor of games in the city of the Oxyrhynchites. 'Yesterday evening a certain Didyme, the wife of Agathos Daimon, the cook, passing my house and finding me standing there with our family, treated us with insolence, using speakable and unspeakable expressions - a woman abundantly furnished with the utmost shamelessness and effrontery. Thereupon, when I stopped her, advising her to keep off from us, she leapt upon me, and, being distracted in her senses, even stretched out her hands and smote me, and railed furiously at some of my daughter's sons, whom I called to witness, and not only at them, but even at one of the officials of our city who was present.;'Having suffered so much, I, the victim of the assault, deliver to you this petition, asking you to give orders that she shall be brought before you, so that I may experience your beneficence toward all men. Farewell.&amp;apos</ab>
