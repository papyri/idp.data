            <p>
               <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 1</note> To my son, Master Dionysotheon, greeting from your father. As an opportunity was afforded me by someone going up to you I could not miss this chance of addressing you. I have been much surprised, my son, at not receiving hitherto a letter from you to tell me how you are. Nevertheless, sir, answer me with all speed, for I am quite distressed at having heard nothing from you. Please go to my brother Theodorus and make him look after Timotheus and tell him to get ready for going in to attend. Already the notaries of the other towns have acquainted their colleagues, and they have come in. Let him remember when he enters that he must wear the proper dress, that he may enter prepared. Take care they do not allow us to fail in coming to an understanding with each other (?), as we know that the same rule applies to us all. For the orders which we received were to wear cloaks when we entered, Therefore let Timotheus, when he comes, come prepared to attend. I salute my sweetest daughter Macaria and my Mistress your mother and all the family by name. I pray for your lasting health, my son. Epeiph 23.
