                  <milestone n="1" unit="line"/> Herakleides to his son Didymos, many
                         greetings.
                         I write to you: do not neglect to go to
                         Pamoutis (son of?) Ptiekl for the arouras
                         on lease, (go to) either him or the men of
                         Protarchos or the arabatoxotes, and what
                         we have changed, send together immediately
                         to Pamoutis the things here. <milestone n="8" unit="line"/> For I spoke to the sailor
                         in order that he takes it on board. Receive from
                         Harpokration a small flask full of oil
                         […]. And do not neglect about
                         your brother to send (those things), and if it is possible, send (them) all together
                         to him. Send (them) for the price they have there.
              <milestone n="14" rend="break" unit="line"/> Takybis to her daughter Helene, greetings.
                         Receive from Harpokration the aromatics
                         […] and the aromatics, the cakes
                         […] and give to Tyrannis, and
                         give to Tyrannis the other aromatics.
                         The […] pieces of papyrus of the aromatics are hers. <milestone n="19" unit="line"/> Give
                         therefore something to Kalliopes, and the rest that is left, give it
                         to Chaireis, your brother’s sister-in-law, along with what you have at your place.
                         Receive from Harpokration
                         the bronze coins, take for me the wool cloths and send
                         them to me. <milestone n="24" unit="line"/> Herakleides […] if you cut
                         the tunic, send it to me; if you do not want to cut
                         it, send me five linen cloths and
                         receive from Harpokration the
                         […] made of hair and send me five pairs of buns.
                <milestone n="29" unit="line"/> Many greetings to your mother
                         and Tyrannis and Aousta and Ninnous
                         and everybody in the house by name.
                         Many greetings to Isidora, greetings to Kalliopes.
                         Hadrianos to Didymos, greetings.
                <milestone n="34" unit="line"/> I want you to know that Agathos
                         Daimon argued with me because of the ten drachmae
                         and with his sister. I swore to you
                         I have payed to Plousia the sixty drachmae and what is left of the
                         […],
                         if the praktor of Theogonis came to you.
                         I pray that you are fine.
              <milestone n="41" rend="break" unit="line"/> Kollouthos to Didymos, greetings. Do not
                         neglect about the eight drachmae; from Mecheir
                         to Mesore there are
                         ten drachmae. If you want to send the linen cloths,
                         send (them), and I would give the money
                         for you.
