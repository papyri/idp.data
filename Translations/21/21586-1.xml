Therefore from henceforth you shall own and possess with your descendants and successors the aforesaid free space and shall have power to sell it to others and manage and dispose of it as you choose without hindrance and no one shall in any wise proceed against you, and I will further guarantee the property always against al claims with every guarantee and free from persons’ property-returns and the cultivation of royal or domain land and from every obligation or debt or lien of every kind, public or private. And I have delivered this bond to you in duplicate with my subscription, and you shall make it public through the bureau whenever you choose without requiring any further consent or concurrence from me, because I now agree to the future publication, and to your question whether this is done rightly and fairly I have given my assent.

The 13th year of Gallienus Augustus, Pauni.
              And whereas I desire that this should be communicated to the keepers of the property registers of the Oxyrhynchite nome, I request that on receiving the publication with the subscription you will give orders for a letter to be written for their information.
              Let the proper steps be taken, The 13th year of our lord Gallienus Augustus, Pauni 9.
