            <ab>Paniskos to his wife and his daughter, many greetings. Before all else I pray before the lord god that I may receive you and my daughter in good health. Already I have written you a second letter that you might come to me, and you have not come. If, then, you do not wish to come, write me a reply. Bring my shield, the new one, and my helmet and five lances and the fittings of the tent. And you wrote to me: "I sent to Heraiskos(?) . . ." and I gave [a talent] to Antoninus, in order that he may pay it to you: so do not neglect . . . So if you have the materials for clothing bring and cut them here. I send many salutations to my daughter and to your mother and those who love us, by name. I pray for your welfare. Pauni 22.;(Postscript:) And you wrote to me that you took twenty[-three?] shields; Tammon, none of them. Temnas has stayed below. I salute you.;;(Verso);;Deliver to my wife, from Paniskos in the house of Par---.</ab>
