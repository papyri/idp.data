            <ab>Paniskos to Ploutogenia, his wife, greeting. I enjoined you when I left that you should not go off to your home, and yet you went. If you wish anything you do it, without taking account on me. But I know that my mother does these things. See, I have sent you three letters and you have not written me even one. If you do not wish to come up to me, no one compels you. These letters I have written to you because your sister compels me here to write. But since you find it impossible to write about this, but write thus about yourself. But I have heard the things which [do not] concern you. Send me my helmet and my shield and five lances and my breastplate and my belt. I salute your mother Heliodora. The letter carrier said to me when he came to me: "When I was on the point of departing I said to your wife and her mother: 'Give me a letter to take to Paniskos,' and they did not give it." I have sent you one talent by Antoninus from Psinestes. I pray for your welfare.;;(Verso);;To Ploutogenia, my [wife - - -]</ab>
