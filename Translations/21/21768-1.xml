I declare that I was selected at the selection which took place under] ..., late strategus and Pamphilus, late basilicogrammateus, and the other proper officials in the wth year of the deified Vespasian in accordance with the proofs adduced in his lifetime by my aforesaid father Dionysius also called Amois, son of Psammis son of Ballarus, who was a guard of the palaestra, that his father Psammis son of Ballarus was in the list made in the 34th year of the deified Caesar of those ... in the gymnasium ; and I myself ever since I came up for selection was included in al the lists of the gymnasium ; and I declare that Thermouthion the mother of my son was married to me in the and year of Domitian by an autograph contract which was also made public through the record-office in the following 3rd year, while her father Plution son of Plutarchus, registered at the South Square quarter, was in the same fifth year of the deified Vespasian placed by Sutorius Sosibius, then strategus, and Nicander, then basilicogrammateus, and the other proper officials in the class of persons selected by Quintius (?)
