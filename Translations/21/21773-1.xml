              To Phocion, strategus, from Ptolemacus son of Herodes and ..., of Oxyrhynchus. A copy of the communication which I have obtained from the record-office is as follows:
              “Celer, priest and archidicastes, to the strategus of the Oxyrhynchite nome, greeting. Let a copy of the application presented to me be served, as below. Good-bye. The 22nd year of the Emperor Caesar Titus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus Pius, the ... of the month Hadrianus. Signed by me, ... written by me, Sarapion ..., scribe of the record-office. “‘To Celer son of the ex-hypomnematographus ..., ex-strategus of the city, priest, archidicastes, and superintendent of the chrematistae and other tribunals, from Ptolemaeus son of Herodes and ..., of Oxyrhynchus.

I beg you to give orders that instructions should be sent to the strategus of the Oxyrhynchite nome to serve a copy of this application upon Ammon ..., if alive, or if not,upon her full heirs whose names will be disclosed on the spot, as is fitting, in order that they may know that the contract with al its provisions is valid.’” (Endorsed) Let the proper steps be taken.
