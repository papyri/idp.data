In accordance with the orders concerning the examination of boys who have reached the age of thirteen years, if both their parents are inhabitants of the metropolis rated at 12 drachmae, Sarapion the son of my brother and sister on the father’s side Sarapion and Tnephersoïs, whose mother is Dogumis(?), was put in the list at the Cretan quarter as having reached the age of 13 in the past 11th year of Trajanus Hadrianus Caesar the lord.
