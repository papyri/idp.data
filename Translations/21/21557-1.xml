            <ab>To those who will be elected consuls in the third year. Hierax, son of  Pesouris, former archon and councilor of the brilliant and most brilliant city of Oxyrhynchos, has leased to Horion son of Theodoros, from the same city, for three more years, from the month Thoth of the present 18th, 16th and 8th year, part of the house and the atrium and the courtyard, belonging to him in the Cretan quarter, from his own dyer's workshop, a room on the ground floor, with all its apurtenances, for the annual rent of three thousand silver drachmas. When the lease has been confirmed, the lessee shall pay the rent annually, half every 6 months, and shall have the use of the premises with its entrances and exits for that period of time, without hindrances and without accusations. And he shall hand back the house in the same condition as he took it. The lease is valid and, having been asked the formal question, he consented. In the same consulship, the twentieth of Choiak (December 17, 323 A.D.). (2. hand) I, Horion, have leased these premises and will pay the rent, and having been asked the formal question, I have consented.</ab>
