The neighbors are on the south the house and court of Horos, son of Harmiysis, and the house and court of others formerly those of Kyrtos, on the north the house of Assar, on the west the house of Taorsenouphis, daughter of Kollouthos, and in part the court of Harmiysis, the fuller, on the east the royal road. And I have received from Kollouthos the entire price agreed upon, in full, from hand to hand, out of the house, and I guarantee with every guarantee from public and private debts and from every claim forever, and &lt;I shall relinquish the house&gt; neither previously sold, nor mortgaged, nor alienated in any way at all.
