            <ab>I, Asklas, son of Besis, my mother being Taorsenouphis, acknowledge that I have sold to Herakleides the younger, son of Maron, his mother being Arsinoe, my half share of the vacant lot that is held also in common and undivided by my brother Patynis, and of all the appurtenances in Tebtynis, the measurements of the entire vacant lot being from south to north seven and two-thirds cubits, from west to east fourteen and two-thirds cubits to the total extent of the measurements in cubits, or as many as there may be, with the exit and the entrance common and undivided. The neighbors are on the south of the entire vacant lot the house of Harmaeis, son of Petesouchos, and of Haryotes, his brother, on the north the house of the said Herakleides and of the sons of Petesouchos, on the west also the house of the said Herakleides and that of Harmiysis and Horos, both sons of Orsenouphis, on the east the house of Orseus, son of Orseus, through which there is the aforesaid entrance and exit to the property. And I have received from Herakleides the entire price agreed upon, in full, from hand to hand, out of the house, and I guarantee the sale against those who shall proceed against it in my name(?) . . . of the half share. My wife, Tepheros, daughter of Tephersos, her mother being Taarmiysis, consents to this sale and agrees not to proceed against it forever or to bring any claim and that no one else shall in her behalf as aforesaid.
