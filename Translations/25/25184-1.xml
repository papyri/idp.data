            <ab>I, Herakles, son of Orseus, my mother being Taorsenouphis, acknowledge that I have sold to Siphon, son of Nepheros, his mother being Taonnophris, in accordance with this sale, from the present day forever, the walled vacant lot that belongs to me by inheritance from my father, in which there are two buildings of composite brick, and all the appurtenances, in Kerkesoucha Orous. The neighbors are on the south the royal road, on the north the lots of the sons of Pasion, on the west the lots of the sons of Papontos, the carpenter, on the east the house and court of Konnos, son of Panesis. And I have received from Siphon the entire price agreed upon, in full, at once, from hand to hand, out of the house, and I guarantee the sale with every guarantee from public and private debts and from every claim forever as aforesaid. Eutychos the elder, son of Eutychos, wrote for him since he is illiterate.</ab>
