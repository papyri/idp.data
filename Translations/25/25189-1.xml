            <ab>I, Taorseus, daughter of Orsenouphis, my mother being Thaesis, with my guardian, Orseus, my brother by the same father and mother, acknowledge that I have sold according to the Egyptian contracts to Psosneus, son of Andronikos, his mother being Thaesis, the half share that belongs to me of a two-story house inherited from my father and all the appurtenances common and undivided in Tebtynis. The neighbors of the whole house are on the south the house of . . ., son of Herodes, and of his brothers, on the north and east the vacant lots of the same sons(?), . . . and his brother, on the west the royal road. And I have received from Psosneus the entire price agreed upon, in full, from hand to hand, out of the house, and I guarantee the sale with every guarantee in every respect forever as aforesaid. Eutychos, son of Eutychos, wrote for them because they are illiterate.;(2nd hand) Psosneus, son of Andronikos. The sale was made to me as aforesaid.</ab>
