            <ab>Chrates, son of Hippalos, about 26 years old, with a scar on his right forearm.;;;;;  I, Chrates, son of Hippalos, my mother being Thaubastis, acknowledge that I have sold, in accordance with the contract of agreement, to Chrates and Herakles, both sons of Akousilaos, their mother being Taos, the fifth part that belongs to me of the vacant lot surrounded by walls, and all its appurtenances, in Tebtynis, formerly the property of Bous and others, and of everything common and undivided, the measurements of the fifth part being ninety-six square cubits, or as many more as there may be. The neighbors of the entire vacant lot are on the south and north and east the houses and courtyards of Chrates and Herakles, the purchasers, on the west the royal road. And I have received from the purchasers the entire price agreed upon, in full, from hand to hand, out of the house, and I guarantee the sale with every guarantee forever. My mother Thaubastis, daughter of Akousilaos, her mother being Taos, consents to this sale and agrees not to proceed against it forever and not to bring any claim, and that no one else will do so on her behalf as aforesaid. I, Chrates, wrote also for my mother since she is illiterate, and I have been appointed her guardian as aforesaid.</ab>
