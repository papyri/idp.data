            <ab>Taorseus, about . . years old, [with a scar] on her left [- - -]. Galates, about 41 years old, with a scar on the small finger of his left hand. Phaesis, about 25 years old, with a white spot on the right eye and a scar near the right knee.;;;;;I, Taorseus, daughter of Thoteus, with my kinsman, Galates, son of Didymos, as my guardian, acknowledge that I have sold to Phaesis, the son of Nikon, my own brother on both my father's and my mother's side, from the present time forever the fifth part that belongs to me of the vacant lots in which there are buildings of composite brick, the measurements of the entire area being whatever they may be. The neighbors are, as we dictated by mutual agreement, on the south the house of the sons of Herodes, with an entrance and exit between, on the north the house of Artemidoros, son of Hermias, on the west the house of Thoteus, on the east the houses and lots of Sarapion, all in the village of Kerkeosiris in the division of Polemon. And I have received the price from hand to hand and I guarantee with every guarantee as aforesaid. I, Galates, also wrote for her since she is illiterate.</ab>
