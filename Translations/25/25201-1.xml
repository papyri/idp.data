The neighbors are on the south and east the royal roads, on the north the vacant lot of Papontos, on the west the other vacant lots of the purchaser, Haryotes. And I have received from Haryotes the entire price agreed upon, in full, from hand to hand, out of the house, and I guarantee the sale with every guarantee from public and private debts and every claim completely forever, as aforesaid. Kronion, son of Annios, wrote for him because he is illiterate.;(2nd hand) Haryotes, son of Haryotes, my mother being Taorseus. The sale was made to me as aforesaid.;;Papontos, about forty five years old, with a scar above his right eyebrow.;Haryotes, about fifty five years old, with a scar on his right shin.;Kronion, about twenty eight years old, with a scar on his left shin.</ab>
