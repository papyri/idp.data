            <ab>(Recto) [Hikane] to Isidoros [her son, greetings.  First of all] I thought it necessary, since the packet boat was putting out to sea, to write . . . me.  I am in Berenike.  I wrote you a letter [?but did not receive a] letter.  Was it for this that I carried you for ten months and nursed you for three years, so that you would be incapable of remembering me by letter?  And similarly you dimissed me though the Oasites . . . not I you.  But I left your brothers in Arabia . . . so that . .  Egypt I might see your face and . . . breath.  I only ask and beg and adjure you by the one whom you . . . and by the memory of the one who begot you, to sail away if you are well.  I . . . Amarantos.  But . . . Arabia, sister has departed and the little one is present . . . I ask and beg you . . . Save your brother.  For I have no one . . . your bother . . . with the first winds, but he found some . . . and came to me in Berenike.  Epaphras greets you warmly . . . and those who love us.  [Year . ., month] 24. (Verso) Deliver.  Hikane to Isidoros her son, harborman.</ab>
