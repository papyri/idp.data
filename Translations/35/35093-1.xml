            <ab>Even before my writing, your worship will not be unaware that there the people from Karanis are not concerned to inhabit their village, nor indeed to pay their taxes to the emperor. And in fact yesterday, I had (so-and-so) flung before the kephalaiotes for collecting a certain sum of money. When I attempted to collected from this man, he snorted his contempt for me and wanted to attack me ... and thanks to the eirenarch and the other liturgist, I was able to collect from this one. Yet, I know not why, that very same man, gathering the members of his household and laid siege to the eirenarch, intending to kill him so that if this occurred they would from then on pay neither merismos nor any other payment.  For today neither an eirenarch nor anyone else has come to me because of what we experienced yesterday, so we just sit here as we are, not doing anything. . .</ab>
