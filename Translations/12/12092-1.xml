            <ab>I, Apollonios, son of Maron, acknowledge that I have ceded to Papnebtynis, son of Ameneus, the one and one-half arourai of vineland that belong to me near Theogonis, the land being measured by the ninety-six-ell schoinion, on the foundation wall in Phremei. The neighbors are on the south the uncultivated land, on the north the canal called that of Ammetis, on the west the uncultivated land, on the east the allotment of my brother Maron. I have received from Papnebtynis the entire sum of money established for the cession and guarantee the sale with every guarantee from all public debts and every impost for past times up to the nineteenth year of Tiberius Caesar Augustus, and from private debts and every claim forever. My wife Tereus, daughter of Chairemon, with me, her husband, as guardian, consents to the sale, and agrees not to proceed against it forever and that neither she nor anyone else on her behalf shall bring any claim against it as aforesaid. I, Apollonios, wrote also for my wife since she is illiterate. (2nd hand) Papnebtynis, son of Ameneus. The sale was made to me as aforesaid.</ab>
