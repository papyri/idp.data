            <ab>To Asklepiades, strategos of the division of Polemon, from Marepsemis, son of Marepsemis, and Marsisouchos, son of Sigeris, and Pachis, son of Marepsemis, all three presidents, and Petosiris, son of Pakebkis, secretary, and Panesis, son of Pakebkis, and Marepkamis, son of Marepkamis, and Marepsemis, son of Marepsemis (also called) Pesouris, and Onnophris, son of Psyphis, and Marsisouchos, son of Marsisouchos, all nine presidents and secretary and (representative) of the tribes of the same priests of Tebtynis of Kronos the mighty god, great and greatest. Whereas for a long time past right up to the present year and day we have been renting to the deceased granary guard Thenapynchis and her living son Apynchis, son of Harmiysis, and his wife Thaesis, in the aforesaid village village of Tebtynis of Kronos the mighty god, great and greatest, the granary in use in which there are a tower and another tower adjacent to it and a gateway, and whereas when we and our other priests took back from the aforesaid Apynchis and his wife Thaesis the granary in which were some of the equipment and doors which he had received, we found in the present month Pharmouthi, of the present 23rd year of Tiberius Caesar Augustus, that the doors which belonged there had been carried off by them and that the granary was not plastered as they received it, so that we have been prevented entirely from being able to bring into the said granary the wheat and barley which we measure out to the treasury as public taxes, therefore we beg you to write to the epistates of Tebtynis to come to the aforesaid granary and view the conditions and send the accused to you for the coming assizes.;(2nd hand) We, Onnophris, son of Psyphis, and Marepsemis, son of Marepsemis, and Marsisouchos, son of Sigeris, and Pachis, son of Marepsemis, and Petosiris, son of Pakebkis, and Panesis, son of Pakebkis, and Marepakamis, and Marepsemis, son of Pesouris, and the other priests, have deposited the foregoing petition. I, Onnophris, have written for them as they don't know (Greek) letters.;(Demotic) (3rd hand) The writer (of this subscription) is Panesis, son of Pakebkis, who says: I have submitted this petition, which Onnophris(?), son of . . ., has drawn up concerning the granary.;(4th hand) Marepkamis, son of Marepkamis.;(5th hand) Marepsemis(?), son of Marepsemis, says: I have submitted this petition.;(6th hand) Marres, son of the like-named, has written: I have submitted (this petition).</ab>
