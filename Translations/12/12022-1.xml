            <ab>To Ptolemaios, royal secretary of the Arsinoite nome, Themistes and Herakleides divisions, acting strategos of the Herakleides division, from Valeria Neilous, daughter of Gaius Valerius Maximus, Antinoite, through her guardian, Serenus, son of Marcus Sempronius Cornelianus, also an Antinoite. Having a case against Chairemon, son of Petheus, from the village of Karanis, about property belonging to myself and to my sister Valeria Sarapias, who is a minor, which property he has encroached on and holds up to half an aroura in the plains of the said Karanis in the place called the �ǣHollow�ǥ, from which he takes no small profit for himself annually; and since the case concerning him requires the investigation of the most illustrious prefect, Sempronius Liberalis, I ask that a copy of this petition be transmitted to him through an assistant, so that, having received a written summons, he may be present wherever the assizes of the nome and judgment shall be held, since I am satisfied with the present statement.;The 18th year of Antoninus the lord, Phamenoth 7.;(2nd hand) I, . . ., have delivered it to him in person.</ab>
