            <ab>I, Orseus, son of Haryotes, acknowledge that I have sold to Galates, son of Lysimachos, to Galates himself [and to his heirs and assigns], for transference from the present day forever, [two slaves] that belong to me, [just as they are], the name of the female being Tyche, her age about six years, that of the male being Kronion, his age about two years. [And I have received from] Galates the entire price agreed upon, in full, and I guarantee the [sale with every guarantee] forever, except against flight and epilepsy as aforesaid. [Dionysios, son of Maron], wrote for [him because] he writes somewhat slowly.;(2nd hand) I, Orseus, son of Haryotes, ordered him to write.</ab>
