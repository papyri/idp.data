            <ab>To his excellency Arrius Victor, epistrategos, from Gemellus also called Horion, son of Gaius Apolinarius Niger, who is afflicted with weak vision, landholder at the village of Karanis in the division of Herakleides. Since your righteous judgment extends to all men, mightiest of overseers, I also, a victim of violence, beg to partake of your justice. The situation is as follows: the elders of the village of Karanis of the same division of Herakleides, men without the least scruple, with their habitual violence and arrogance &lt; - - - &gt; me whom they nominated as their colleague under the name �ǣHoros, son of Apolinarius,�ǥ a fictitious name which I do not know. For this reason I do not know it, for neither did it set forth �ǣdisabled�ǥ or �ǣinfirm�ǥ or any other of my distinguishing marks, nor it is indeed permissible for me, since I am an Antinoite, to be styled otherwise, nor indeed to perform a liturgy again except in Antinooupolis alone. Furthermore, I was granted the right to wear the chlamys by the citizens at a meeting of the senate. Since not only am I one-eyed, but also I do not see with the eye that supposedly remains, because a cataract has appeared in its pupil and my sight is impaired, on this account I addressed a petition also to his excellency the a censibus(?), and I received the sacred rescript, of which a copy follows: Alfenus Apolinarius to the strategos of the division of Herakleides, greetings. . . . petition . . . Horion . . . .</ab>
