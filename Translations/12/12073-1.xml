            <ab>(1st hand) Chairemon to the clerk of the grapheion, Kronion, greeting. Subjoined is the copy of a petition that has been presented to us. Be so kind, then, as to follow up its statements as is fitting. Farewell. The twenty-third year of Tiberius Caesar Augustus, Choiak third.;(2nd hand) To Chairemon, the exegetes, from Taorses, daughter of Eutychos, with, as guardian, her relative Ptolemaios, son of Chairemon. My husband Galates, son of Lysimachos, died, leaving by me three sons under age, Lysas, Lysimachos, and Eutychas. For them I have had myself appointed guardian by you. Galates, with his brothers Didymos the elder, Didymos the younger, and Lysimachos, was indebted to Kastor and Lysimachos, both sons of Lysimachos, in accordance with a mortgage executed in the . . .teenth year of Tiberius Caesar Augustus. This mortgage affected the catoecic estates belonging to them by inheritance from their father consisting of a catoecic allotment of eighty-two arourai in the division of Polemon. Of these there are in the vicinity of Tebtynis thirty-seven arourai in two parcels, in the vicinity of Theogonis twenty-five arourai in one parcel, formerly the property of Lucius Terentius, and in the vicinity of Kerkesis the remaining twenty arourai in another parcel. Accordingly, the aforesaid arourai of the allotment amount to eighty-two or thereabouts. The properties adjoining each parcel and the other details are set forth in the said mortgage. In consideration of the sum of two talents 1,200 drachmai borrowed through it and of the interest that has accrued  from the time of the said mortgage up to the present, Kastor and Lysimachos have laid claim to the aforesaid eighty-two arourai of the allotment on the basis of the transfer of title which they caused to be made in the twenty-first year of Tiberius Caesar Augustus through the bureau of registration of catoecic lands, and have made a partial cession to their own brothers. We have, therefore, entreated both Kastor and his brother Lysimachos to deal kindly with us on condition that we shall give them 2,500 silver drachmai toward a share of the public taxes and other debts which Galates and his brother owe, and on condition that all of us resign our claims and approve the transfer of title effected through the bureau of registration and also the cessions made to the brothers of those about Kastor. I therefore petition you in the names of my said sons who are minors, and of myself as their guardian, with the brothers of Galates, Didymos the elder, Didymos the younger, Lysimachos, and Haryotes joining in the petition, to give orders to write to the clerk of the grapheion to prepare with me the agreement of renunciation and approval concerning the sixth part which was inherited by my sons who are under age. The guarantee is to rest upon me together with the brothers of Galates under conditions of mutual surety, in order that I may be benefited along with my sons.;(3rd hand) It has been approved. The 23rd year of Tiberius Caesar Augustus, Choiak 3. (2nd hand) Farewell.</ab>
