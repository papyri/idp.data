            <ab>I, Herakla, daughter of Harmiysis, with my guardian, my own husband Tithoueis, son of Herodes, and the sons of my dead sister Taonbesis, Harpaesis and Pannos, both sons of Harpaesis, and Apynchis, son of Apynchis, all four acknowledge that we have sold to Sadalas and Nikon, the two sons of Sadalas, in accordance with this sale, from the present day forever, to each of them a half share, common and undivided, fo the half share that belongs to us of the house that has fallen to pieces and of the court that adjoins it, and of all the appurtenances, in the village of Theogonis in the same division, common and undivided. The neighbors of the whole house and court are on the south the lots of the sons of Alkimos and others, on the north the entrance and exit of Thaubarion, daughter of Bremon, on the west the wine press of the sons of Alkimos and others, and in part the court of Peteesis, son of Peteesis, son of Belles, on the east the royal road. And we have received from the aforesaid Sadalas and Nikon, half from each of them, the entire price agreed upon, in full, at once, from hand to hand, out of the house, and we guarantee the sale on mutual security with every guarantee forever, from both public and private debts and every claim forever as aforesaid. Kronion, son of Haryotes, wrote for them, because they are illiterate.</ab>
