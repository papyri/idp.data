            <ab>To his excellency Calpurnius Concessus, epistrategos, from Gemellus also called Horion, son of Gaius Apolinarius, Antinoite. Of the petition which I submitted to the most illustrious prefect, Aemilius Saturninus, (2nd hand) and (3rd hand) of the sacred subscription which I obtained from him, I have appended a copy. I request, if it seem good to your Fortune, that you write to the centurion stationed in the Arsinoite nome to send the defendant for your examination and that you hear my complaint against him, in order that I may obtain justice. It is as follows:;To Quintus Aemilius Saturninus, prefect of Egypt, from Gemellus also called Horion, son of Gaius Apolinarius, Antinoite, and however I am styled. I appeal, my lord, against Kastor, tax collector's assistant of the village of Karanis in the division of Herakleides of the Arsinoite nome. This person, who held me in contempt because of my infirmity ��� for I have only one eye and I do not see with it although it appears to have sight, so that I am utterly worthless in both ��� victimized me, having first publicly abused me and my mother, after maltreating her with numerous blows and demolishing all four doors of mine with an ax so that our entire house is wide open and accessible to every malefactor. These were demolished and we were beaten although we owed nothing to the fiscus, and for this reason he dared not even produce a receipt lest he be convicted through it of injustice or of extortion. Wherefore, since our savior has ordained that those who are victims of injustice shall approach you without fear in order to obtain justice, I request, my lord, that I be heard and avenged by you, so that I may be the object of your beneficence, and that the defendant be sent by your authority for your examination. I, Gemellus, have submitted this petition. I, Germanus, wrote for him. The 6th year, Mesore 18. Petition his excellency the epistrategos, who will not be found wanting in matters whithin his jurisdiction. Return to the petitioner.;(4th hand) I, Gemellus also called Horion, have submitted this petition, as aforesaid. I, . . . son of Panebtichis, wrote for him since he is illiterate.;(5th hand) The 6th year, Mesore, the 3rd of the intercalary days. Petition (me) when I have arrived in your locality. (6th hand) Return to the petitioner.</ab>
