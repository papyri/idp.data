And I will not absent myself by day from Heron's establishment, but will accompany him all over the nome. And for each day that I do not remain with him, I will pay to Heron two drachmai of silver, and I will do everything as aforesaid. Sarapion, son of Ptolemaios, wrote for him because he is illliterate.;(2nd hand) Heron, son of Haryotes. The agreement was made with me as aforesaid.</ab>
