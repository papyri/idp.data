            <ab>(Recto);;Iollas to Zenon greetings. I have given you [my oath about the fact that - - -] and that I heard badly of him. When I heard that you were &lt;Read: he was?&gt; angry at me, I came to [- - -] and clasped his knees (in supplication). For 'Zenodoros' didn't permit me to go [[to Bia]] 'to him'. Now [after learning] the orders [you gave to] Zenodoros, [he] didn't obey [anymore to] Zenodoros, [but - - -] five scourge-bearing Egyptian men [- - - he] whipped me brutally, so that my skin was even cut through and now [- - -] has &lt;Read: I] have?&gt; been even worse treated by [him]. I was about to run away and go to you [- - -] Zenodoros prevented me (from doing so), in order that the work, he said, may not be [hindered], but he asked me to write word to you. Now [- - -] but, when you will be here, all that happened will be reported to you. For Bia is the one who commits the outrages [- - -] For she(?) makes herself master of us and of that man. May you prosper.;;(Verso);;To Zenon.;(Docket, 2nd hand) Iollas the weaver about addaios and how they have treated him with violence. [Year 29], Daisios 21, in Arsinoe.</ab>
