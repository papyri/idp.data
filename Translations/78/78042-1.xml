            <ab>Herais to sister Loukretias greetings. Before everything else I pray that you are in good health, too -and I prostrate before lord Sarapis on your behalf. Don't be concerned about Antonius. Until now, he has not yet enlisted in the army. I want you to know that those who sojourn in Egypt are under the authority of the epistrategos. If you travel up to Antinoopolis, write me at once so that I may come to see you. But if it turns out that you are not going, then write me too so that I won't go under difficulties (?) from this place to there. Know that, when I arrived downstream, I found Eros locked up, and I went to your brother. No matter how often I asked him, he did not want to set him free but said: "If he wishes to go upstream, then he shall pay profit to the orphans". On the forth day after I came to the city, Nephotianos came too. Write us whether you have received the purple dye from Peteesios, the boatman. Greet Lukretias, Eutychos, and Apphys [[and Apollonia]]. Antonios, Koprous and Nephotianos greet you.</ab>
