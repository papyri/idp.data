            <ab>From Gemellus, freedman of [[Gemella]] Helene, from the metropolis of the Oxyrhynchite nome. Last year, [[my lord, wrote]], my lord, in the month of Pharmouthi, Claudius Calvinus, who then served as procurator, wrote to [[Nemesianos]] the then strategos of the nome, Nemesianos, a letter in which he indicated that when I was then superintendent of the Moschos estate, which includes a bath, and of three workshops in the same estate, I, along with Didymos, son of Didymos, who is a landholder in the Saite nome, was cited for 3 talents 1253 drachmai and more in the list of arrears sent from the fiscus; and (he ordered him) to take pains to sequestrate my property till I should settle my debts to the treasury. When I learned this, I immediately entered my claims in a petition which I presented to Nemesianos for him to forward 'to the procurator', since illness prevented me from sailing down myself at that time. These claims I now indicate also for you, my lord, pointing out for you the only days that I served as co-superintendent with Didymos and showing the accounts; for in the 14th year of the deified Aelius &lt;read: Aurelius&gt; Antoninus, on Pharmouthi 6, I was sent by Isidoros, formerly strategos of the nome, acting through his assistant Serenus, a sealed letter that had been sent for me by Septimius Severus, then procurator, in which he appointed me superintendent of the said estate; I went to Alexandria, and after I took up my office of superintendent on the 12th, I asked, on the 11th of the following month ofPachon, to Serenus that my time might not be counted(?) anymore from the same eleventh, and he granted me that, as he made known in his records for the 21st . . . as follows:;Serenos said: . . . will be counted . . . [- - -] . . . legal advisor . . . in the Oxyrhynchite [nome] through Claudius Ptolemaios, the then kosmetes,;and after he had approved after scrutiny my sickness(?), he released(?) me from the office of superintendent, as he made known . . . for the 11th(?) (of Pauni?) as follows:;Serenus said: . . . will be appointed(?) . . . 'I took office as sitologos . . .' my colleague . . . Didymos, son of Didymos, landholder in the Saite nome . . . the accounts . . . (he) stated . . . about which . . . [- - -] 'the copies' of what was sent to me by the then strategos Isidoros and of the records concerning my appointment and my release from office and of the accounts concerning this(?), which were recorded by Didymos after my release, [[I ask that you take knowledge of these claims of mine, according to which I stayed in office as superintendent for only 30 days, 'and that the sum that has been shown is still owed to me for my expense', and that the sum wrongly posted under my name be cancelled]].;(Correction written in the right margin:) I ask, my lord, that [you] take knowledge . . . of these claims of mine, according to which I stayed in office as superintendent for only thirty days, and that the sum that has been shown is still owed to me for my expense, and that the sum . . . wrongly . . . be cancelled . . .;Here are (the copies):;- of the (letters) sent to me by  the then strategos Isidoros:;Isidoros, strategos of the Oxyrhynchite nome, to his dearest Gemellus, freedman of Helene, daughter of Ptolemaios, greetings. I have sent to you, through my assistant Serenus, a letter written to you by Septimius Severus, the most excellent procurator, which arrived sealed to me today, sent over by the . . . of the nome, so that you might forthwith take action on your orders, according to what he wrote to me too. I pray for your help, dearest. Year 14, Pharmouthi [6].;[- - -];;(Other corrections are too fragmentary to be translated).</ab>
