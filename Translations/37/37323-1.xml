            <ab>To my most honored lord and brother Kyrillos, Theodoros.;I have sent you the memorandum of the assistant of the councillor . . . by our comrade Eudaimon. When you receive it, collect the wages and the assistant's fees from him as it says, and furnish half of the monies furnished to Heraklammon's mother; for you know that she too is in need. And if you are better, come to us; for my lord the praeses is looking hard for everyone. And communicate to my lords and brothers Antiochos and Theon the pagarchs that I submitted their report immediately, without delay, my lord the ab actis not being in Herakleopolis but in Arsinoe, and I sent a letter about this matter to the councillors by the same Eudaimon, on the pretext of the erection of columns for the basilica(?). Be good enough to have all the hay transported while you are still in the city, and remind the same individuals, that is, Antiochos and Theon, to supply their asses for its transfer just as he announced. Having already sent the libellus of my lord and brother Didymos, and having received the reports of the lord of my soul Isidoros from my lord and brother Sarapion - for he turned this task over to me - I am having collected . . .;(Inserted in the lower right corner:) I pray for your health through many years, my lord brother.;(2 lines in the left margin too fragmentary to be translated);;;(Verso);;Collect the holokottina from Harammon the contractor, for we need them badly, but leave with Heraklammon's mother whatever she desires. For Andreas the numerarius has met me and he is going to be troublesome to you in the matter that you know. When all the subordinates of the officium were sent up I had Zoilos's assessment reduced on the grounds that he is being treated injuriously. And although I laid up ill(?) I gave the reports to my lord the praeses. And already, as I predicted, they are carrying out the collection. I instructed my lord Timagenes to send them all up, and my lord the advocate did exactly the same thing at the same time.;;(Address, written in the opposite direction:);To my all-honored lord and brother Kyrillos, clerk, Theodoros.</ab>
