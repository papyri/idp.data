            <ab>Thermouthis to Nemesion, greetings. I want you to know that Lucius has come. About his smock of coarse sackcloth, which you have in the city, if you come down bring it. He has the hood (soubrikos) here. I gave it to him some time ago on his word alone, so that he might have it until you come down. And about the shepherds' wages, he said, "I am sending a soldier . . . immediately," he says, "to seize such of the shepherds belongings as are still in place." He has not given me our mattress. "Bring me my old one," he says. And about the shovel, he says that you asked them for three staters per shovel. Farewell. Year 5 of Nero, Epeiph 13.;;(2 lines of another text, written in the opposite direction by a different but equally unsophisticated hand. An attempt was made to wash off the text. - Too fragmentary to be translated.);;(Verso);;Deliver to Nemesion</ab>
