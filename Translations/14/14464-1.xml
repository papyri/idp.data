            <ab>Tenth (?) year of Imperator Caesar Titus Aelius Hadrianus Antoninus Augustus Pius (month, day) in Tebtunis of the division of Polemon of the Arsinoite nome. Herakleia, daughter of Kronion, about � years old, without distinguishing feature, under the guardianship of her brother, Kronion, about twenty-four years old, with a scar in the middle of the forehead, acknowledges to Pakebkis son of Marsisouchos, exempted priest, about � years old with a scar � right � that she has received from him, Pakebkis, hand-to-hand out of the house one thousand three hundred silver drachmas plus the interest which he owed her according to a contract of loan drawn up by the same grapheion in the eighth year of Antoninus Caesar the Lord on the 7th of the month Thoth; and she has surrendered this contract to him for invalidation. Nor shall Hera take action against Pakebkis concerning what she has received, as stated above, in any way, nor shall Hera suffer any decrease with respect to what Pakebkis owes her according to a contract of the present year for a principal in silver plus interest, in accordance with the contract. (2nd h.) I, Hera, daughter of Kronion, under guardianship of my brother, Kronion, have received from Pakebkis the one thousand three hundred drachmas plus the interest which he owed me according to the contract, and I shall not suffer any decrease with respect to the other matters, as stated above. I, Kronion, wrote for her since she is illiterate. (3rd h.) Pakebkis, son of Marsisouchos: a receipt has been drawn up for me without erasure, Herakleia suffering no decrease with respect to what I owe her, as stated above. (4th h.) Registered by Ptolemaios, in charge of the grapheion.</ab>
