Julius Casianus must repay the principal to Valerius Serenus on the above date and the interest monthly without fail and the same interest for the time beyond payment. Moreover, he will deliver the mortgaged small house clear and without encumbrance and not pledged in security for another loan, and no agent of his may take action against it in any way before the appointed time of repayment. If he does not act justly in accordance with the terms, the party entering the into possession of the mortgaged property will have the right to (assume assume ownership of?) it and to manage and dispose of it as he chooses, the guarantee resting upon Julius Casianus perpetually. And if, unfortunately, any accident or reduction or anything else at all happens to the mortgaged property or any part of it, neither the loan nor the interest will in any way be the responsibility of Valerius, who will still have the right of execution against all the property of the debtor because the loan is guaranteed against risks.
