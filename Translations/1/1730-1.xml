            <ab>	Alexandros to Zenon, greeting. If your health is good and your affairs move (according to your desire,) it would be a pleasure to me. I am well. Since Mys was about to join you, it seemed best to me and to Mys himself to send a memorandum (in which) he should remind Apollonios about the allowance which Mer)Ptos had ordered to be paid to me until I had received what was T i due. Since the time of his [Menetos'] death he [Apollonios] has not paid (the allowance). I have concluded that it would be well to write also to you in 9rder that, if the matter requires your assistance, you may co6perate zealously both on my account and that-of Menetos. Whatever I may ask, if you desire it, will meet with every favor from Apollonios; and I will be cognizant of the fact that I have been saved and restored through you. Regarding these favors I also shall endeavor, in so far as possible, to make return of gratitude to you. Good-bye. 

[Verso:] Alexandros, concerning the pay 
coming to him. Year 28, Dystros 24. 				To Zenon. 
In Memphis.
