            <ab> [Erased line:] To Eukles from Apollonios greeting. I have sent you - - - -
To Eukles. I have made up the grain account of the leasing of year 3 on the basis of the remission granted in accordance with the decision taken in Memphis, and I find that the overpayments, as converted into wheat, are 4430 artabs and that the remainder of the price of - - - which is at the bank - - - - -- at the value of the 2000 (artabs) already measured, totals, on the copper standard, 500 (drachmas); and that the same is likewise true on the basis of the accounting by individuals. For, whereas Aristandros formerly, according to the (original) survey, owed 750 artabs in wheat conversion he now pays in a surplus of 600 artabs according to the remission granted. Therefore, if you please, preferably send Herakleides the farmer, if he has the time, but if not, let him send an order to Herakleides the sitologos, or let him send Chairigenes, in order that if possible he may reject - - - (or ask) me to present the accounting by individuals in order that the (remainder) from the farmers (may not be lost to the royal revenues [?]. For if they) make the repayment of surplus in the produce of year 2, it will be satisfactory. If the account is rendered still showing discrepancies, it will be difficult. For I have not met with the temple scribes or those serving with Alexander. For it would be most desirable to compare the grain accounts so that, if you devised some better plan, we might there in your presence follow it. But as to the Syrian laborers, of whom you state in the list of the workmen that some are engaged in the vineyard work, and others at the farming, I think you are not unaware that they have been taken away.
