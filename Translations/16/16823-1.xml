            <ab>In compliance with the orders regarding the selection of boys who have reached the age of 13, when their parents from both sides are inhabitants of the metropolis, assessed at 12 drachmas, I declare that my son [N.N.] his mother being Tautosiris, daughter of Thoonis, enrolled in the district of Dekate, has reached the age of 13 in the current ninth year of Traianus Caesar the Lord. And, therefore advanced to his epicrisis, I declare that I am over sixty years of age, formerly assessed at twelve drachmas, as entered in the poll-tax list of the 3rd year of Domitianus, enrolled in the same district and that his mother���s father, Thoonis, son of Ammonios, grandson of Noeris, his mother being [N.N.], died in the fourth year of Domitianus formerly assessed at 12 drachmas, as entered in the recognized list of the poll-tax of the [ . . ] year of Nero Augustus and I swear by greatest Imperator Caesar Nerva Traianus Augustus Germanicus Dacicus that I have told the truth. Year nine of the Imperator Caesar Nerva Traianus Augustus Germanicus Dacicus, 7th Caesareion. [I, N.N.,] son of Dionysios have registered the above-written facts and I have sworn the oath. [I, N.N.,] have written it for him, as he can not write.</ab>
