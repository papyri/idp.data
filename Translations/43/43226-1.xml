            <ab>"��� In the name of the our Lord and Master, Jesus Christus, our God and Saviour, year 29 of the reign of our most pious master, Flavius Heraclitus, perpetual Augustus and imperator, 19 Epeiph at the beginning of the 13th indiction in Arsinoe. Aurelius Gergios, bald on the forehead, son of Phoibammon, and Aurelius Sambas, son of Pekysios, from the village of Herakleia in the Arsinoite nome to Aurelius Phoibammon, alias Patokos, son of Cosmas, and Aurelius Georgios, son of Phoibammon, having the same name, from the city of the Arsinoites, greetings.;We acknowledge on mutual obligation that we have leased to you a total of eight arouras, i.e. 8 (arouras) in total, which belong to us in the plain of our village in the area of the kleros called Plaiaty to the north of the kleros  of the son of Thaisarion, on the condition that you sow and harvest these arouras and have profit from them yearly, from the harvest of the coming fourteenth indiction onwards, and that you provide us yearly four gold nomismatia, minus twenty-three keratia as rent for these, on the first day of the month Epeiph - and you cannot disregard the payment of the said rent each year. And if it happens that an additional payment is placed upon the arouras of Menas, son of Benjamin, you in your turn will pay the additional payment on the said arouras proportionately, and if it happens that the said arouras are destroyed by the inundation, you will point them out to us and they will be free from taxes and, on the other hand, if they are saved from the inundation and if it happens that the arouras to the west and east and north of these [arouras] will be sown, you will again pay us the same four nomismatia yearly as rent. We have also thrown down upon you the costs as the said Menas (threw them upon us), and if we ourselves want to sow the said [arouras] swe shall be free to do so. The lease is valid, and we, having been asked the question formally, have agreed. ���We, Geogios and Sambas, assent to what has been written above.;(2nd hand) ���Through me, Georgios, has it been drawn up.</ab>
