            Soknopaiou Nesos, Herakleides division. <milestone unit="line" n="4"/>I have a room in the house of the wife 
            of my son Aurelius Tesenouphis in the hamlet called Pisai, Themistos division, in which grain 
            is stored for my nourishment. <milestone unit="line" n="9"/>Lately as my relatives went to the room because 
            I myself was in Alexandria, it was discoverd that the grain stores had been pilfered. 
            <milestone unit="line" n="12"/>The cause of 
            the theft has become apparent to have been that the ill deed was perpetrated when the room, 
            which is situated in the upper level, had been holed through the floor. <milestone unit="line" n="15"/>Once 
            those who are living there were convicted that this had happened through their malic 
            aforethought, they promised through the intercession of the 
            <term target="archephodos" xml:lang="grc-Latn">archephodos</term> of the village and through others 
            to give (me) seven <term target="artaba">artabas</term> of wheat against the amount of 
            the [theft], <milestone unit="line" n="20"/>but since they bound themselves on the one hand with a promise, 
            but, on the other hand, have not up until now complied with the restitution, <milestone unit="line" n="22"/>of 
            necessity I seek refuge with you and request that the accused Panouphis, son of Stotoetis, and 
            Pakysis, son of Kanneis, be brought before you, so that through your authority I may be enabled 
            to receive the seven <term target="artaba">artabas</term> of wheat granted 
            <app type="BGU"><lem resp="BGU I, p. 358">to me</lem></app> in place <app type="BGU"><lem resp="BGU I, p. 358; cf. BGU III, p. 2 after p. 352">of the greater 
                number</lem></app>, which have 
            been stolen. <milestone unit="line" n="28"/>Farewell.
