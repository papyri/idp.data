            <ab>"Greetings, my lord, Theon, from Chairemon. I wrote to you that I had received a price of two . . . talents for pitch from the potter's son, with Pamphilos also present. Although the potter had raised no objection, he balked . . . at my coming to take the pitch. When Serenos came prepared to take it and we went to the pottery, the potter objected and kept me from giving him the pitch, saying "I need it." So up to now it is stored in the pottery under my seal. For your information, I am writing you that I returned the price which I got from Serenos.;There have issued . . . Theon, from the first wine-press 720 tetrachora and 10 dipla, from the second wine-press likewise 847 tetrachora and 10 dipla. The matter of expenses has been a burden to us because all have made the vintage at the same time and we do not find men easily. I will let you know when we finish with the other wine-presses. Do not be concerned about all these tasks. I have sent you also now additional jars to the number of 600. I pray for your good health.";(Recto): " From Chairemon, deliver to Theon."</ab>
