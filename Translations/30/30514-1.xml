            <ab>Isidora to Sarapias, her daughter, many greetings. Before all else I pray for your health, together with that of your household, and I make obeisance for you and for your child in the presence of our lord Sarapis. You know that I am despondent on account of your brother. I have not received his deposits because I have been sick; they have &lt;fixed&gt; days for receiving them. In regard to what you said: �ǣSend a chiton for the little one,�ǥ if I find a trustworthy person I will send it; and if the god wills I come to join you. Whatever I have belongs to you and to your brother. I hear that you have quarreled with your husband on account of your father. He has not stayed with me because it is winter. Send him to his own place; if I go upcountry I shall manage him again. I am waiting for Apollos. Perhaps he will enlist in the army; whether he enlists or not, I must go upcountry. Write to me soon about your well-being. If you wish to write a letter, it is in the house of Serenus, the brother of Scambys, that I await his obeisance, (to bear it?) in the lap of Sarapis. Salute the father of the children and the children. Salute Thausarion. Salute your children. Salute Peeous and Pemes. Do not force me to reproach you, Onnophris, for her unpleasantness. Apollos salutes you and your children.;;(Verso) Deliver to Onnophris, priest . . . from Apollos, the son of Salibotas.</ab>
