            <ab>Ammonianos to his dearest Moros, gretting. Bearing in mind what you had written concerning a fine of 4000 dr, I was not intending to delay, first in the matter of the ... pitch, second in the matter of the chitons; but the matter of the pitch has been concluded. Do you even now take pains not to neglect to send me the linens. For I  knew that it is impossible for you to bother the weaver, whom you suggested to me, who is like "wherever the ravens fly ". (Of course), you will say: "there is a lack of weavers".  there is slight discord among the linen-weavers. For concerning the chitons, if you know that not more than 240 dr. was given for them, as Kopreus told me, send them to me now. And if you went to any expense for the linens, let me know. Nevertheless, when you have obtained the remainder from Kopreus &lt; &gt;; otherwise, let me know again and I shall pack them into the semi-bolster and send them to you by someone else. And I did not receive anything from Petechon, nor catch sight of him. Search him out and collect from him ...</ab>
