            <ab>Cyra and Aia to their lord and brother Apynchios, very many greetings. Put all things aside and come immediately to us because our mother has died and we badly need your presence. Therefore, please, do not stay at your place but come to us or we shall ruin our household. You yourself know that we cannot do anything (without you. Eagerly we wait) your presence. For that reason we have also sent our brother Martyrios so that you may come immediately to us with him. We must be very grateful to him because he undertook the trouble of the journey to you although we paid the expenses. We greet our sister, your wife,  and her children -may the evil eye not touch them - and through many years. Do not neglect it and feel repentance afterwards. Come immediately to us so that you may arrange everything.;verso: Deliver to our lord and brother Aphynchios from Kyra and Aia.</ab>
