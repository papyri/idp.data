N.N., his mother is Helena, from Aphrodison in the Small Oasis a female, white, full-grown donkey without a brand, for an agreed price of three hundred twenty drachmas of minuted imperial silver coinage which acknowledging party, Pallas, son of Hatres, has received on the spot in full from the said Herakleides and (Pallas acknowledges) that he will guarantee (the donkey).  And if somebody lays his hands on it saying he is the owner, the acknowledging party will remove him at his own expenses or - if he does not - he will hand back to the said Herakleides the afore-mentioned price which has been paid to him.  The (contract of) sale is authoritative.  Year 7 of Lucius Septimius Severus Pius Pertinax and Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Caesares the lords Augusti on the 2nd of the month Hadrianus.
