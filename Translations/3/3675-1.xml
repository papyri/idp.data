            <ab>To Menches, village scribe of Kerkeosiris, from Apollodoros, the contractor for the distribution of and the tax upon oil at the said village for the 4th year. I have already presented a memorandum to Polemon, the Epistates of the village, concerning my discovery on the 27th of Phaophi that there was at the house of Sisois son of Senapynchis in the shrine of Thoeris here a quantity of contraband oil. I immediately took Trychambos, the agent of the oikonomos who had been sent for the payment, since you and the other officials did not wish to come with me, to the house alluded to, and went there with him. Thereupon the aforesaid Sisois and his wife Tausiris set upon me and belabored me with blows, and having driven us out they shut the door of the temple and of the house. Subsequently on the 4th of Hathyr I encountered Sisois near the temple of Zeus here, and wished to arrest him, Ineilos the sword-bearer and Trychambos being present. But Pausiris the brother of Sisois, a porter, and Belles and Demas and Maron son of Takonnos with others whose names I do not know hurled themselves upon us and overpowered us, belaboring us with blows with the cudgels which they carried; and they wounded my wife on the right hand and myself also, the resulting loss to my contract amounting to 10 talents of copper. I accordingly present to you this statement, in order that you may order the proper officials to exact from them (this sum�) (Here the papyrus breaks off)</ab>
