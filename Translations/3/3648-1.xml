            <ab>Menches to his brother Herodes, greeting and good health. You must know that Ammonios our late agent (?), being in the office of Amenneus the basilikos grammateus, has written to us concerning the detention of Aroteus the son of Petearphres by the basilikos grammateus for the survey of the village and the measurements; and he has written to me to join them. I have asked him to wait for me until the 21st. So soon therefore as you receive this letter �, and for the rest take care of your health. Goodbye. The 52nd year, Mesore 18. Menches to his brother Ammonios, many greetings. I have received the note written by you in which you inform me among other things about � Give the turn-table (?; Gr. periphora) to Dionusios for the survey, and tell him to join them at daybreak; for you know how busy I am, and that I am in attendance upon the strategos. Bid Dionusios wait till I have finished with this work on the 21st. I accept completely your views, and am over-joyed that Athemmeus the .. has been instructed to go up. Let me know in your turn anything that you want, and for the rest please take care of yourself.</ab>
