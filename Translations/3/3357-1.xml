                  <milestone n="1" unit="line"/> To king Ptolemy, greetings, Philista, daughter of Lysias, of those living in Trikomia. I am wronged by Petechon. 
For as I was bathing at the bath, the one in the aforementioned village, in year 1, on Tybi 7, he was serving as attendant in the women’s bath; 
and when I exited, so as to clean myself off, he, bringing in the ladles for the women’s bath, scattered my … and burned my belly and my right thigh down to the knee, 
so as to put me in danger of my life. Finding him, I handed him over to Nechthosiris, police chief of the village, while Simon, epistates, was present.                   
<milestone n="6" unit="line"/> Therefore, since I have fled to you as a suppliant, I need you, king, if it seems right to you, to not overlook me, 
treated so unjustly, (as I am) surviving by means of my handiwork; but order Diophanes, the governor, to write to Simon the epistates and 
Nechthosiris the policeman to bring Petechon before him (Diophanes), so that Diophanes may make an examination about these matters, (and) so that I, 
having fled to you, king, the common benefactor of all, may find justice. Farewell.
                  <milestone n="12" unit="line"/> (in a second hand) To Simon: Send the accused. Year 1, Gorpiaios 28, Tybi 12.
