            <ab>To Menches, komogrammateus of Kerkeosiris, from Demas son of Sentheus, cultivator of Crown land and assistant for the cultivators of the said village. On the 8th of Mesore in the 4th year while I was engaged with the said cultivators in the collection of the sums owing for the leases of the same year, Pyrrhichos son of Dionysios, one of the katoikoi hippeis, and Herakleios son of Poseidippos, an inhabitant of the said village, proceeded thither with many other persons armed with swords.
