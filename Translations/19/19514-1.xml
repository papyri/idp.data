From this sum I have here received from you from hand to hand three thousand drachmae, total 3,000 silver dr. The remaining … drachmae you will pay me by the 30th of the present month Hathur of the current 12th year of Aurelius Antoninus the lord, and I will make the conveyance whensoever you please by an official deed through the record-offices in Hermopolis in order that you may receive the authorization of the land-registry office free from all liability. For the public dues on the holding and all additional levies from former times up to the past 11th year of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Caesar the lord I, the vendor, am responsible, while you are responsible for those from the present 12th year inclusive; and I will henceforth guarantee the said land with every guarantee.
