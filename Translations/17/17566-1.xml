	                                        [In the name] of our Lord and Master Jesus Christ, [our God and Saviour. In the 10th year of the reign] of our most pious master [and most high benefactor Flavius Mauricius] Tiberius, the eternal Augustus [and Imperator; during the consulate of the same] most pious master, [9th year month, day 10th indiction; (5) in the city of Oxyrynchus. To the most reverend] George, priest [of the holy Church, inhabitant] of this city of Oxyrynchus, [the Aurelii James and Victor,] full brothers, sons [of Phib, their mother being --, inhabitants] of the hamlet of Lucius in the [Oxyrynchite nome, greetings.] (10) We acknowledge that we have received from your [reverence and] have borrowed from hand to hand [out of your house, for our personal] and public urgent needs, seven [solidi of gold,] private standard, [say 7 sol. g. pr. st., which] we shall perforce [repay to your] (15) reverence free from any risk, together with the interest, viz. sixty-four [bundles of grass] from the one and a half arurae [on which we grow] double (?) grass, (the capital) whenever [it will suit your reverence,] the interest of course [in the month of Pachon (?) of the] present 10th indiction. As [a security for] the (20) return we have forthwith mortgaged [in favour of your reverence, according to the right] of pawn and mortgage, the possession of the same one and a half [arurae, lying in our aforesaid] hamlet, at the west of it. And [we shall be free neither] to withdraw the one and a half arurae form [this mortgage before] (25) the full repayment [of the same debt] neither by sale nor by hypothecation, nor [to dispose of it in any other way] to the detriment of the debt, nor [to pretend to have given part] of it without a statement written by your reverence; our possessions being a surety for this [debt.] (30) The bond written in one single copy is [valid] and to the formal question [we have said yes.]
                                        (Subscriptions of James, Victor and the notary. Docket on the verso).
