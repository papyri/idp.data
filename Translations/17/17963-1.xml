            <ab>Following the consulship of the most illustrious Flavius Basileius, Hathyr ?, in the ninth indiction.  To Flavius Ammonius the most magnificent count of the sacred council, son of Theodosius of splendid memory, through the most respected administrator Apollos, son of Dioscorus, from Aurelius Psaeus, son of Horus and mother Tatas, a farmer from the bounded plain of Phthla in the Antaeopolite nome. Greetings.  I acknowledge that for the price of barley which was purchased for me by you I owe you and am, without dispute, indebted one third solidus, which totals 1/3 (solidus) of gold, and I will repay this to you in the month of Mecheir during the present ninth indiction, without deceit and at my own risk and expense.  And having been questioned, I agreed. (H. 2) Aurelius Psaeus, son of Horus, the afore-mentioned: it meets my agreement, as it is laid out above.  I, Apollos son of Komasius, having been asked I wrote for him because he is illiterate.  I, Aurelius NN, am witness to the debt having heard from the executing party.  I, Aurelius Johannes, son of Cornelius, am witness to the debt, having heard from the executing party.  It was written by me, Cyrus the notar (nomikos).</ab>
