            <ab>[Apollinarius] to Tasoucharion, [my] lady mother, many greetings. Before all else, I pray for your good health, as it is [my wish], to make obeisance to you (and find you) in good health [. . .] and life. You ... me [. . .] if I know in the [. . .] for ... not yet [. . .] of (my) parents, and it is most of all my wish. For each time I remind myself [of you], neither do I eat, nor do I drink, but I cry [. . .] to me alone [. . .] . . . I give thanks to Sarapis and Good Fortune that while all are laboring the whole day through at cutting stones I as an officer move about doing nothing. And I received some money and wanted to send you a gift of Tyrian wares; and since you did not reply, I have not entrusted it to anyone on account of the length of the journey. For fine garments and ebony(?) and pearls and unguents are brought here in abundance(?). Therefore I ask you, my lady, to be . . . and merrily joyful; for this is a good place. For if you are grieved, I am uneasy. Do you now give yourself the trouble to make inquiry of a friend of mine at Alexandria, so that you may send to me through him coarse-fibered linens. For there is none here and the weather is very hot. I ask you seriously not to annoy my lady Iulia in anything, since you know that . . . protects me doubly(?) . . . . I pray that I may make obeisance to you, after the gods, (and find you) in good health. And if you received the set of . . . I ask you without delay to reply to me concerning your health, so that I also may have consolation. Salute Iulia, Sarapias my lady sister, grandmother Sambathion, . . ., Eros, little Ptolemaios, . . . my brother, Ammonous and their children, Betes, Dius, Ptollas, . . ., Ptollous. Clemens . . . came with his man. I greet all those at home. I pray that you be well and happy. Mecheir 25.;;(Verso) [For Tasoucharion,] my mother; deliver to Iulia . . . .</ab>
