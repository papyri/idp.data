            <ab>Ninas(?) to Thaisarion, very many greetings. Before all else I pray for your health, and I make obeisance for your every hour in the presence of our lord Sarapis. I want you to know, sister, that I did not write a letter to Koprous, for I informed her of everything by word of mouth. When she went upriver, the affair had not yet reached a conclusion, but now, I thank our lord Sarapis, everything has turned out well. But the &lt;official&gt; communications have not come out; I am expecting them. Know that your brother Ptolemaios has sold all his property, namely, the share which falls to him of the eight arourai near the village Sebennytos, to Philoxas the cavalryman; and &lt;his property&gt; in the hamlets Pammebeis, Penes, Tbynis, Kollauthis, Psens, and Pilipite, and the share which falls to him of a palm grove in the hamlet of Okes ��� all these have been sold to Heras, your son. And now, except that I was in Alexandria, he would have sold all your property and mine and our mother's. But I thank Ptolemaios, the husband of Heuremon's daughter; through him everything was accomplished. He used me like a brother. If Sarapis permits and I receive the &lt;official&gt; communications, I come to join you. I also gave Koprous all this information by word of mouth, so that she might tell you. If you know that the village secretary has put me into a liturgy, inform me into what kind of liturgy he has put me. And if anyone has injured you, let me know his name by letter. Give many salutations to my brother Ptolemaios, and to Diodora, and to Longinus, and to . . ., and to Gemella, and many salutations to my mother.;(2nd hand) I pray for your good health.;;(Verso) (1st hand) [To Thaisarion] daughter of Xistis, from [Ninas(?)] her brother.</ab>
