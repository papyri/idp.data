            <ab>Herakleides (?) to his dearest Horion, greeting. All who send letters send them concerning the camels. I detained the men who accompany the camels. For it was after we had loaded the camels with bones that the letter was brought to me. [This was a good thing] for I was able to buy . . . at the price of one hundred twelve drachmas the metretes. [And it proved timely, too,] for strangers have come looking for olive oil. When you were sending us lentils, you should have sent grain also, since you know that we have none to furnish. If you do not wish to send it now, it can be obtained [here] at the price of a stater for one and one-half metra. If you send an advance now, send five five artabas of wheat. Lentils are being sold at the rate of two metra for the stater. I received through Phatres one hundred ninety-six drachmas and four artabas of lentils and fourteen . . . at an obol each and . . . at the rate of two obols each, and the fish. Receive from Soueros a basket in which there are one metron of jujubes, thirty pomegranates, and fifteen gourds. Tell me at what price for the artaba you wish me to buy succulent olives. For they were all asking for grain and lentils by way of advance in order that they might make preparation. Receive from the same messenger a basket in which there are two metra of fresh dates and the six metretes two choes of old wine - it is only with much trouble that I find any - and twelve artabas of bones.  Greet Helen, Thaesion and her children, and Ptolemas. Farewell. Let (?) . . .nos, the son of Appian, come (?) at once. I have not found the cotton chiton as I should have liked. If you want to have one woven for you here, send warp thread and the measurements. Take thought about the grain which is being sent to Psobthis and the grain of Chairas. Do not neglect any one of all these things. Receive from Phatres, the son of Chairas, a basket in which there are three metra of dates and fifty pomegranates and a letter. See that you do not neglect it."</ab>
