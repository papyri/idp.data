            <ab>[Tabetheus(?) to Claudius Tib]erianus, her brother, very many greetings. [When I learned that] you had come to Alexandria, I was very happy together with my entire family, [and do you write to me in reply] that you are coming to us immediately, since your son(?) . . . waited for you during your absence until today. And to the present moment we wait for you [daily ] together with the children. Therefore, I ask you to come [to] us [immediately]; we will make obeisance to you together with the children if you come up . . . . your daughter Segathis serves me; she is prudent and . . . capable. She sent your(?) son Isidoros to you so that [he might take to you] your belts [in the company] of soldiers, because she remains in attendance on me lest [the flood] come in the river with great [violence], since I am not able to leave the house on account of . . . . Isidoros and Segathis salute you, and we salute . . . the children. I received a letter from Claudius, your son, [from which I learned that] as soon as you come to me [you will take] me to Alexandria along with Segathis . . . . to the present moment you have not yet been willing to come.</ab>
