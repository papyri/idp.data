            <ab>Claudius Terentianus(?) to [Claudius] Tiberianus, his father and lord, [very many greetings]. Before all else I pray for your health [and success, which] are my wish, and I make obeisance [for you . . .] daily in the presence of [our lord Sarapis] and the gods who share his temple. I received [your letter, from which I learned] that you also sailed up in the [boat] that you found [going to] the Arsinoite nome(?). I want you to know that after [you] left [I] registered the document, as requested(?), and [was at a loss] because I needed the person in whose name the document was [drawn], in order that he might record it(?). For without him I am unable to register [it]. I also looked up Papirius Apollinarius [and told him what] I had heard from the notaries, and he said [to me], "Let it go [until] he is able to come down." Inasmuch as you [are neglecting your] affairs by remaining in the country, [come to] Alexandria, since [I] have waited in Alexandria. Having gone up into the country, [you are neglecting them totally]; but [even] when you were here you neglected to settle them . . . . If you sail down, they can be dispatched . . . . You write me that you have sent(?) . . . through Anubion, but he does not know that you wrote [to me here] and has given me nothing. From the day that you went upcountry until today, for the first time, I have received the letter and the basket through Aurelius; and do you be concerned, my lord father, to write to Anubion(?) lest he disregard me . . . . . . . And I ask you, if you are able, to send [me] sandals without delay, since I derive much benefit [from them]. For you know that we are working hard now, in view of the fact that we are suppressing(?) the uproar and anarchy of the city. You will do [well] to send down to me . . . and to Gemellus three(?) . . . . I want you to know that after the above had already be written to you the basket was brought to me . . . by Anubion's father(?), and now at last I have it. Since I have found no one to send because I am ill, you will therefore do well to conclude your business quickly and sail down to me. For the illness is at this moment no laughing matter(?), and it is even necessary that I be fed by someone else, [as] you will hear when you come to [the city]. Isidoros and Sempronius [and] all who love you truly and completely(?) send many salutations to you [as well as] Zotike, whom you will bring down with you when you come because you know that we are going to need [her] here. Salute all your friends, each by name. I pray for [your health] through many years.</ab>
