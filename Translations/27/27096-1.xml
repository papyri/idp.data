            <ab>Sempronius Clemens to his most esteemed Apollinarius, greeting. I received your letters from your &lt;father&gt;, Iulius Sabinus, from which I learned that you state, not that I was unable to attend to your affairs, but that, as you say, I was unwilling. And, of course, on this point I understood, but nevertheless I shall present my justification. For the delay arose in the fact that Valerianus, not by his own wish, but because his wife controverted our orders to him, went off straightway to her. Since in this situation you enjoined upon me with considerable earnestness to write to you, in order that in this way no further reason for delay should again remain, I indicate that under pressing need I am going up to Antinooupolis and shall write to you from there with reference to these matters. And if per chance Fortune permits me to set out hither from Antinooupolis, there is no delay. For I shall write to you immediately after this distraction, so that you may not be anxious concerning your affairs. For in this way I shall show you how not again will I neglect anything.;(2nd hand) I pray that you be well together with all your household.</ab>
