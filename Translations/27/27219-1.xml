How - - - often - - - that our lord Harpebekis with great pleasure (5) receives the 'kyphi' from you? You have sent all the ingredients which are put into the 'kyphi' together with bitumen and resin. You wished that from this resin the sufficient quantity should be added and that we(?) should announce you what has been taken(?), in order that you could send the copy of the recipe? - - (b) (11) - - - in Memphis. I thank my lord that once again he has confirmed that you will live a long (15) time for me, sir. Indeed, by his fortune, if something should happen to you before my circumstances have become favourable for a sufficient time, I shall run the risk of perishing as a miserable man in a miserable way. Greet all your people by name; they are greeted by the people here. Farewell, my lord (20) and father, in hapiness for long years. Thoth 7th.
