            <ab>Terentianus to Tasoucharion, his sister, very many greetings. Before all else I pray that you be well together with your entire family. Receive a basket from the man who delivers the letter to you, and write back to me what you find in it. And I have sent you another basket by Valerius the goldsmith. Please write to me, when you receive it, both about your health and anything you may need. For I hope soon to go upcountry to you. Do everything possible to provide for us two keramia (of the largest size) of olyra and an artaba of radish oil. I sent you the marjoram that goes with the oil. And if you received from Ptolemaios what I wrote . . . write to me . . . . Our children salute you . . . . Salute . . . with all his house, and Ptolemaios the son of Arius, together with their wives and children. Salute Ptolemaios and Tiberinus and . . . . to send a fresh bundle(?) of asparagus by Melas, since we ask it of you, father, send one bundle(?). All the persons in the house . . . salute you, each by name. I sent you papyrus so that you might be able to write me concerning your health. I pray that you may always be well.;;(Verso) Deliver to Tasoucharion from Terentianus.</ab>
