            <ab>Theon to his most esteemed Apollinarius, greeting. If we had not learned that with the gods' help you are now well after what you write you have suffered, we would have left everything and hastened to you; for nothing is more precious to us than you. But even though we are here, we pray for your health, for you deserve it. Alexander, the builder, came immediately after your departure, and when he was informed that on his account you remained with us a number of days more in order that you might spend some time with him, he was grieved that he did not find you here. He made mention of you constantly in our company . . . . Let me therefore know the price, so that I may pay it over to your(?) brother Apollonius. All the men in the household and the women of our household salute you. I pray for your good health, most esteemed . . . .</ab>
