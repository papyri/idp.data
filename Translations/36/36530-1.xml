And now, after these, as there was doubt between us both concerning the said things in the field of our same blessed parents, since the property is taxable to the fund of our village … 
the synteleia of which and tax collection by the Public Treasury we could not bear to endure and we have often wished to give it away to the poor, and turn away from it, 
but also the rest of the estate on the pretext of the same property, until when, through the mediation of some friends, among whom … and the clarissimus uncle on our mother’s side, 
lord Kollouthos the scriniarius, we assumed their management over again and have made a just division of them for each other and satisfying to our friends,

currently fruit-bearing, so that I, together with those who will succeed me and will receive all my inheritance, by just aim and division, 
according to the considered agreements to hold, rule, and own continually, from now and forever.
<milestone n="53" unit="line" rend="break"/>I have also been allotted together with these, and no less, (b) an entire house situated in the same village of Arabon, 
near the holy church of the passing-through-all-trials martyr Apa Theodoros, open to the east, together with its original door and its side entrance, with all its rights,
