            <ab>Agathon to Patron, greeting. I have written below for your information a copy of the letter from Menodoros. Goodbye. The 4th year, Pharmouthi 8. Menodoros to Agathon, greeting. We have written below for you a copy of the letter which we have written to the collectors in the several toparchies in order that you may be informed and send instructions to your local agents to release out of the produce the amounts measured out to the sitologoi for the dues entered on their books, and to retain the rest of the grain, as we have written to you in previous letters. To Theophilos. Since the time for receipts from the royal holdings has arrived and the sitologoi are met together with you, I think it well to write to you in order that, as regards the cavalry holdings, having left enough grain for the money dues owing on account of the past and for the money revenue until we refer to Phanias about this, you may measure to the sitologoi from the surplus produce (?) from the half-holdings pertaining to the state the grain dues entered on their books, and similarly the taxes, both the medical tax and the crown-tax for the ten-day period, and also from the whole holding the guard-tax upon the holdings. If anything remains from these half-holdings, let it be your care that both it and the half-holding pertaining to the cavalryman be kept until the reckoning and until we write to you what should be done. The purchased grain of which they have received the value beforehand �, as we have instructed you previously. If any of the cavalrymen have given the epistatai affidavits about the produce, hold back the proper amount for the crown-tax for the 4th year to make up the deficiency, until we have referred � to Phanias. Goodbye. The same letter was sent to Harpalos, Antiphanes and Argaios. (Addressed on the verso) To Patron. (Endorsed on the verso) 4th year, Pharmouthi 8. Concerning the half-holdings, instructions for measuring dues, �</ab>
