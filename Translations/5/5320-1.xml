            <ab>Sokonopis, supervisor of the distribution of State papyrus at � for the 23rd year to the epistates at Tali and the archipylakites and the phylakitai and desert-guards and the komarches and the village scribe, greeting. Petoos who � has contracted with us for the distribution of the State papyrus at Tali for the said year, and it is within his competence to take declarations on oath by the king from the notaries that they will not use private material of what appertains to the contract nor purchase from smugglers but only from the royal shops. You will therefore do well to support him zealously in any matter connected herewith in which he needs your help, and if he hands over to you any persons who are competing with him as sellers or are smuggling, take them, together with any supplies that they may have, and bring them before Zopyros the epimeletes, in order that they may be mulcted in the due penalties. Good-bye. The 23rd year, Thoth 26.</ab>
