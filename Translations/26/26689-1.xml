            <ab>Sempronius to his brother Satornilos greetings. I have received two letters from you, one concerning the things I have made clear to our brother Maximos, the other about our lady mother, that she has been in danger and that she is still unwell. You must know, brother, that I shall be very anxious and that at the same time I shall not sleep at night until you let me know how is doing in that climate. Do not waste time until you find someone who will sail downstream to me. Confort our brother Maximos as well as you can. I have also written to our brother Valerios about that. I hope that he also realizes how deeply sorry we feel about [ ]; but how can we be of any help thereby? Not he alone but all of us are bereft of her. Therefore, regard us as not being able to help, but do not think humanly in excess certainly not such a moment.;;Sempronius to his mother Satornila, greetings. the moment you receive this letters let me know how are doing because I am not a littele worried until I hear about your affairs. Concerning my brother Maximos I will now write to you so that you may comfort him --- the unsuitable times do not leave me --- that not he, too, out of sorrow turns himself towards something else. For I know that you, too, are in sorrow on behalf of him, but, lady, come to your senses because of my brothers. And this had to be because he loved his daughters and his (?) sister Siborra equally. But can we do against a thing against which God cannot do anuthing? Farewell.;;verso: deliver to my brother Valerius and to my brother satarnilos from Sempronios.</ab>
