This is the last will made in the street by me, Taptollion, [daughter of N.N.,] son of Ptollion [ his mother being N.N.] from the village of Phthochis, normal and in possession of all my faculties having as guardian my nephew Harmiusis, son of Nechthnikis, grandson of Ptollion his mother [N.N.] . As long as I am still alive, I have complete power over my own possession to make further stipulations concerning them and to make other provisions concerning them, whichever I want to, and to make this will null and void, and whatever I stipulate will be valid. But id I die without this will being altered, I leave behind as my heirs Harmiusis, alias pelx.

Should one of them die without children and without a will, his portion of my estate shall belong to the other; should the other one, which God forbid, also die without children and without a will, it shall not be contested that one of my next of kin shall benefit, and absolutely no-one shall be allowed to violate one of these stipulations, or else, without affecting the validity of these stipulations, the person who tries to make any part of these things invalid shall pay to the person who observes these stipulations, a fine of thousand drachmas and an equal sum to the public treasury.

Should one of them die without children and without a will, his portion of the inheritance shall belong to the other; should the other one also die without children and without a will, it shall not be contested that one of my next of kin shall inherit my possessions, as is written above.
