            <ab>"Aquila to my lord Ptolemaios, greetings.;I want you and my lord Thrasynis to know that when I came out yesterday I saw the man of Toka harassing the steward of Athas and Leon the field guard because they did not believe him when they said that we had sent the letter to him. But today also they assailed our men in considerable numbers, saying in their folly: "We want an answer to the letter. You probably opened it and did not send it to him." If it seems appropriate to you in this instance, send them a reply as you think fit, so that they my no longer harass our men and the entire locality. For they were saying: "Since he is our landlord, on this account we wrote to him, so as not to write to an unknown. We cannot hand over (?) the cypress timber (?) to an unknown.";I shall go along the river if a ship is to be found there. I pray for your good health."</ab>
