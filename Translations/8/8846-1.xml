            <ab>As I enjoined you concerning the . . ., please, brother, send me the six jars, through my brother, on the 9th, and provide for as much others as you can. I have also sent the little Didymos with my brother. Know that I have received from Heron, the elder, a note on behalf of Syrion, son of Apynchis and Sarapous, also called . . ., .- - -, and 5 others. I have also sent you the current archephodos with a letter concerning his affair, ordering him to come back by the ninth hour of the present day, which is the 7th. I write to you so that you know and do what you want. If you want to . . . him until that hour, I will expedite them. Take care also of the swines, of necessity, until the ninth.;(2nd hand) I pray for your health.;(1st hand) Have, you too, a copy of the names with you, if you want, until the hour. Display it, as the copies I had have been entered in the records. I have sealed the letter with the figure of Harpochrtes. (2nd hand) I pray [for your health].</ab>
