            <ab>Peteminis to Protarchos, greetings. On the 11th of Pachon, while we were patrolling the village, at nightfall we came upon Pasis, son of Paopis, royal farmer, injured. He reported (that) some men attacked him at Stone canal. We then rushed southward from the village, wanting to ascertain what had happened. We found Manres, son of Orses, likewise inkjured. Asked by us who they were, they denied that they recognized them. But some of them said, 'He was injured by us with barge poles.' On the 12th, we hear which of the villagers they are whose names are appended below for you: Pasis, son of Semtheus, Horos, son of Onnophris, Pasis, son of Manres, Horos, son of Apynchis, the grain measurer. Although we looked, we did not find them at the present time. If they fall into our hands, we will bring them up to you. I have written to you, therefore, so that you might know.;Farewell. Year 11, Pachon 15.</ab>
