            <p>
               <milestone n="1" unit="line"/> Antigonos to Dorion, greetings. You wrote concerning Kallidromos: for me now, at last, to force him to give back the donkey 
or pay him (i.e., the donkey’s owner) its value. But Kallidromos… Dorion… to exact from him the value of the donkey, 20 drachmas. 
Therefore quietly, in accordance with the letter you wrote me, I led Kallidromos off to the desmôtêrion in Sinaru 
so that he might give the donkey back to Dorion; but Patron, the phylakitês, arriving at the desmôtêrion, 
released Kallidromos from the desmôtêrion, with the result that I could not exact the money. He led the donkey off to his 
house and is keeping it there, out of sight. If I had not been unwell, I would have taken it from him by means of a machairophoros. 
I have written to you concerning these matters so that you may know that the violence of Patron is responsible for the fact that the 
restoration to Dorion did not take place. Patron has continued to disobey your commands. Farewell. Year 4, ….
(J. Bauschatz, Law and Enforcement, pp108–109)
