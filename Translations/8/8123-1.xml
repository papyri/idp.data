            <ab>"[I am being wronged by Tettaphos who is the chief-of-police of Lysimachis. For on the 1st of P]aun[i in the] 6th fiscal [year, he came to my shop and asked me for the himation that] Tha[sos the isionomos of the residents] in Ly[simachis had given m]e to clean; [when I asked him for the stipulated payment, he] made no reply, but attacking me in the aforesa]id village with Meniskos and Xennias, [he laid hands on me - - -striking me] with fists and kicks on whatever part [of my body] he chanced [- - -. When (?)] he had given [me] into the custody of the phylakites, since it was the hieromenia, [I was released and I went (?) to] Krokodilopolis on the 3rd of the same month. [- - -] Tettaphos, against whom I lodge this complaint, taking Peteuris, the phylakites, and [- - -] searched, looking for me in order to beat me up, [but not finding me] because [I was] in Krokodilopolis, they lay in wait for me until - - [- I returned to my work]shop. Thus Tettaphos, Xennias, Meniskos, Mermippos and P[- - -] entered [my workshop] carrying clubs, attacked me [with numerous blows, and] scattered my inventory in the presence of [Peteuris, the] phylakites, on which matters I called him to witness. [- - -] in the violence [many things,] the quantity [of which] I do not know, were ruined. Poseidonios, [the oikonomos, requested that] Poseidion, the strategos, write to [Tettaphos] to proceed to Krokodilopolis, and] I ask [and beg you, O king, to order Poseidion, the] strategos, to request Tettaphos to [appear before] him [and - - -; to submit (?) into the village [- - - on these matters that have been] done against me, [Poseidion to decide (?). When redress and [- - -] have taken place, [I, if you so decide, will] have happened [upon your] help, [O, king.] Farewell.</ab>
