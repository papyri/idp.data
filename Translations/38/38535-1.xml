            <ab>[1-4 too fragmentary to translate]. 5. ... immediately I paid these 135 solidi, as I was ordered to do in the letter ... and I received the document which I have here with me. I am writing with the request that your Excellency make every effort to ensure that I receive, also from the lord comes, a commision for payment or an authorization, so that there will be no delay in this matter. On the twentieth of Phamenoth came the scoundrel , and I did not give him permission to enter the house. I am nevertheless amazed to learn that your nobleness has not yet rreturned to your house, since already a long time ago she (?) wrote that she was leaving for home. Please be calm concerning what was written to Your Excellency about me, that is concerning the purchase of the goods. With the help of God we are in good condition. Please be kind to write to me about the much desired godd health of Your Excellency and the state of your strength. Many greetings to your strong Excellency from its slaves (?). Phamenoth 29.</ab>
