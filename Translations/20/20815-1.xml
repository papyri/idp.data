            <ab>� in accordance with the letter sent by him the total amount of the increase was received. The following is a copy of the letter: Horas (?) � to the strategos of the Hermopolite nome, greeting. I forward the petition of Harthotes son of Harthotes, which I have signed. As therein declared, he has been assigned by me at the auction on the 10th of the past month the post of prophetes and the other offices at the price of one talent, and has carried up and paid to Secundus, procurator of the lord Caesar, 1500 drachmas with the extras, and has previously paid on the spot 1500 drachmas with the extras. It is consequently right, if this is so, that you on receipt of the remainder of the purchase-money should hand over to him the offices. Good-bye. The 7th year of Hadrianus Caesar the Lord, Mecheir 15. Received from Harthotes son of Harthotes for the post of prophetes and the other offices out of the sum of one talent, after the 15000 drachmas agreed upon as payable by himself in return for which he had been assigned the offices and which were paid on Mesore 20 of the 5th year, and after another 1500 drachmas agreed upon in the 6th year as payable by Marsisouchos, the remaining sum of 3000 drachmas.</ab>
