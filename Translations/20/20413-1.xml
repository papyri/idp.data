              Inserted on the register.
              To Demetrius and Apollonius and Diogenes, keepers of the records, from Leonides son of Diodorus son of Diodorus, his mother being Saraeus daughter of Leonides, of Oxyrhynchus. My parents, Diodorus son of Diodorus son of Agathinus, and Saraeus daughter of Leonides son of Alexander, her mother being Isidora daughter of Calas, of the said city, in accordance with the contract of marriage made between them through the record office of the said city in the month Sebastus of the 1ath year of the deified Claudius settled upon their joint issue the whole of their property, in order that after their death it might be the secure and inalienable possession of their children; and whereas my father died leaving me and my brother and sister, Diodorus and Thais, his heirs, and his property devolved upon us, and whereas our mother possesses at Nesla 9 1/2 arourae and at Peënno 2 1/2 arourae of the concessional (?) land of Thrasymachus, together making 12 arourae, and bestowed upon my brother and sister aforesaid through their marriage contract 4 each of the arourae at Nesla, that is one-third of the aforesaid 12 arourae: I too declare for registration my right to the remaining 4 arourae of my mother; and the aforesaid contract of my parents remains in force and uncancelled to the present day. The 1st year of the Emperor Nerva Caesar Augustus, Pharmenoth 19. <note>Signature of Demetrius and date.</note>
