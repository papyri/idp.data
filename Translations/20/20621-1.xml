The appointed term having elapsed and the repayment not having been made, I request you to give instructions for a letter to be written to the strategus of the Oxyrhynchite nome to present a copy of this petition to Sarapias, if she is still living, and if not, then to her heirs being of age, and if they are minors, to their lawful guardians, whose names will be ascertained on the spot, in order that they may be informed and may make repayment to me or else may know that I shall take the proper proceedings to which I am entitled for entry upon possession, as is right.
