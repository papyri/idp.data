            <ab>Thus, as soon as you receive this letter, instruct those in your district not to sell any of the items(?) that are to be bought in your district in accordance with the orders we have given at a price above the tarif that was specified in our earlier orders.  Do not hinder those of the village from selling these things at the price that has been named, referring them to these orders and making them aware of this in advance.  You should know that if we discover anyone who has bought things for more than the tarif stated in our orders, we are going to give you a harmful reprisal in return.  Next, tend actively to the matter of those palm branches, following our instructions completely and in these not giving any reason at all to take action against you.  Written on the 7th of Pachon in the 9th indiction.</ab>
