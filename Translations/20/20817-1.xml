            <ab>To Titus Flavius Artemidoros, Neokoros of the great Sarapis, ex-kosmetes, priest and exegetes, and the Caesarii and the other prytaneis, from Thenherakleia daughter of Herakleos son of Onnophris, her mother being Herois, from the village of Tebtunis in the division of Polemon in the Arsinoite nome, with her guardian, her brother Herakleos the younger, from the same village. Being unable at the present time to make the voyage to the Arsinoite nome, I appoint in my stead by the present memorandum the other brother of myself and Herakleos, being also my husband, Herakleos the elder, who is present and consents to this appointment, to sail up to the aforesaid nome and to appear before the strategos of the divisions of Themistos and Polemon or before his highness the procurator of the Imperial estates, Ulpius Herakleides, whenever he visits the nome, or before his highness the epistrategos or before any other judges before whom it may be necessary to come, against both Heron also called Sarapion, ex-exegetes of Arsinoiton polis, the heir of Turbon, ex exegetes of the said city, in connection with the 38 arouras at Oxyrhyncha in the said division which are unjustly held by him and belong to Herakleos in accordance with his claim of ownership, and also against Menches and Sansneus of the village of Kerkesoucha Orous in the same division concerning a lease of pastures, and to carry out everything. Wherefore I request you to give instructions to the officials in charge of these matters or whomsoever else it may concern, in order that if Herakleos appears before them they may act with him while carrying out everything in my name during my absence, just as I should have the right to do if I were present, for I consent to these provisions. (�) Year 15 of Imperator Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Augustus Armeniacus Medicus Parthicus Germanicus Sarmaticus Optimus, [month, day].</ab>
