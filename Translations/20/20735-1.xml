               <note>Translation: from P.Oxy. 1</note> To Theon, strategus, from Apia, daughter of Horion, son of Apeis, her mother being Tareous of Oxyrhynchus, with her guardian who is her husband Pasion, son of Pausiris, his mother being Tseei, daughter of Callias, of the same city. My above-mentioned father Horion, son of Apeis, son of Horus, his mother being Taërsis, registered as an inhabitant of the village of Berenicis in the Arsinoite nome, who happens at the present time to be at the village of Nemerae in the Oxyrhynchite nome where I and my husband live, and owns as a place for residence three portions of the house that belongs to me in the northern part of Nemerae, namely the exit belonging to it and two upper chambers, a dining-room and a bedroom, has fallen ill and is in a precarious condition. As I have no intention of entering on his inheritance, I am obliged to send you notice, that you may give instructions about the next step to be taken, in order to free me from responsibility after his death.
