Ioudas son of Iosephos, Jew of the Epigone, has lent to Agathokles son of Ptolemaios, Jew, taktomisthos of the infantry of Molossos stationed in the Herakleopolite nome, two talents five hundred drachmas of bronze money for twelve months from the date above written with interest at two drachmas per mina per month. This loan is the amount which Agathokles still owed to Ioudas out of five talents which he had received from Ioudas as an advance towards a money-changing (?) business in partnership according to a written agreement, of which Ananias son of Ionathan, Jew of the Epigone, is the guardian. Agathokles shall repay to Ioudas the aforesaid loan and the interest in the month of Mecheir of the eighth year; but if he do repay it as stated, he shall pay it increased by a half. This agreement is valid.
