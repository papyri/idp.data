            <ab>(Recto);;[- - -] the Saitic nome. Know that we are keeping the camels in the (village) of Nechthenibis as we were not able to bring them down to Hermou polis; for several floods are open and waters have been released everywhere. Makron also said that he has sent to Alexandria 200 sacks(?) of the value of 1,000 drachmai and that he will send another 200 besides. Write to us then what you instruct us to do [- - -] and write also to me about anything that you desire, as I shall be pleased to serve you. Farewell.;Know too that the charcoal of Asklepiades amounts to only 30 sacks, and these are being held by the people to whom Asklepiades was in debt, so that we are unable to do anything about them. Write therefore to the chief policeman, whose name is Harmiysis.;;(Verso);;. . .     To Zenon.</ab>
