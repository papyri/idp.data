            <ab>(Col. I, lines 19-30) I have appended for your information a copy of the notice delivered to me by Adymos son of Adymos, eighty-arouras-holder. Goodbye. The 22nd year, Tybi .. To Horos, komogrammateus of Berenikis Thesmophorou, from Adymos, Macedonian, holder of eighty arouras. On the night preceding the 2nd of Tybi certain persons having made an incursion into the quarters belonging to me opened the room in the courtyard and stole a � mill which I value at 500 drachmas and from the courtyard three young sheep worth 600 drachmas. I therefore send notice to you, in order that you may make inquiry into the same. Goodbye. The 22nd year, Tybi .. (col. VI, lines 12-26) Phamenoth 23. To Harmais, topogrammateus. I have subjoined copies of the notices delivered to me on the 2[.]th of the present month from Timon, leader of the men from Asia, and Phanesis, donkey-driver, in order that you may be informed and give proper heed. To Horos, Komogrammateus, from Timon, leader of the men from Asia. On the night preceding the 2[.]th of Phamenoth in the 22nd year certain persons got over into the house of Phanesis the donkey-driver and drove off a black donkey which I had hired out to Phanesis and the son of Phanesis and valued to Phanesis and his son at 1 talent. I beg you to set my notice on the list. (Col. VIII, lines 4-9) Another from Herakleides. On the night preceding the �th of Epeiph of the 22nd year certain persons got over on to the house of Ptolemaios in which I live and (possessed themselves?) of the best of two beasts of burden belonging to me, which I value at .. talents of bronze. I have delivered a notice to the guards. (Col. VIII, lines 17-28) Another from Pnepheros son of Harkoiphis, Crown tenant from Berenikis Thesmophorou. I am wronged by Ptolemaios son of Sosipatros, hundred-arouras-holder. On the 24th of Epeiph of the 22nd year, I sent my son Pnepheros to � with 3 pairs of oxen and when he wished to cross the bridge in the road the aforesaid Ptolemaios violently seizing the boy's stick drove them into the canal and one of the three cows, worth 2000 drachmas, happened to be killed by a crocodile. I beg you, if you think fit, to order a letter to be written to the proper official to compel restitution to be made so that I may be able to cultivate my land for the 23rd year. The 22nd year, Epeiph 2[.]th. (Col. XI, line 3 - Col. XII line 4) � On the 2nd of the aforesaid month at a late hour Dorion the desert guard arriving at his house in the street opposite the shrine of Boubastis came upon Hesiodos son of Didymos, hundred-arouras-holder, at the door, and unpleasantness having arisen, Dorion � the nose of the aforesaid Hesiodos [slitting?] the nostril and cut (?) his lip �; and Hesiodos cut the right ear of Dorion clean off � We have appended for your information the notice delivered to us by Hesiodos. The 22nd year, Mesore 2nd. To Horos, komogrammateus of Berenikis Thesmophorou from Hesiodos, Thracian, 100-arouras-holder of the 5th hipparchy. On the 2nd of Mesore of the 22nd year, as I was returning home at a late hour and had arrived at the Boubastis-shrine of Patsontis, Dorion son of Dionysios, one of the desert guards, attacked me along with certain others and gave me many blows with the sword he had, so that I received many wounds and my nostril [was slit?]. Wherefore I have sent notice both to you and to the guards. � An outcry being raised � he took to flight � my life is in danger. The 22nd year, Mesore 4. (Col. XII, lines 17-21) Likewise from Alexandros. The produce in wine of Elpines son of Elpines for the 22nd year, 12 6-chous jars, 1 8-chous, 8 5-chous, total 20 six-chous jars, he has sold to meet his debts to Petosiris son of Sokonopis, a � from Berenikis, at 275 drachmas each, which makes 5,500. I have therefore written for your information.</ab>
