            <ab>[recto] Greetings to Chairemon, most honored. I have been brought to the president of the town-council concerning the sum of the payment, since you wrote that 5,500 dr. was paid, but he had asked for the payment of the whole talent.

Pompeianos . . . a talent and he still owes 5,500 dr. and it still holds . . . giving the whole . . . for the accounts posted in your name [l. 20] from which you carried out the performance of kosmeteia. [margin] I salute your children and your wife  . . . .  I pray you be well.
