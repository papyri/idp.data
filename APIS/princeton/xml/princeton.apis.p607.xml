                  <summary>Petition.  Someone from the plaintiff's village had married a woman from another village and had become a leader in raids against his former villages.  The petition seems to be an appeal to the headman of the village to restrain his people from their lawless acts.  If no such action is taken, the plaintiffs will act for themselves, apparently without recourse to law or higher authority</summary>
