                  <summary>Portion of an official record of a trial held in the court of the chrematistai, sitting in Crocodilopolis; details of the case remains obscure but it seems that someone connected with the case had been instructed on the thirteenth of Mecheir, in the twenty-third year of an unnamed ruler, to appear in court on the same day to attend the hearing of the case; his appearance in court was prevented, however, by the fact that on the same day he was occupied in taking a letter from the praktor in Crocodilopolis to the epistates in the village of Philadelphia</summary>

            <ab>son of -isodoros also called . . . of the village of Alexandreus, but not yet enrolled in the Hephaistiea deme, dwelling in Philadelphia of the Herakleides meris of the same village . . . of the court of  [l. 5] chrematistai, of whom Theogenes was the introducer of the case, of the 23rd year, the 11th of Mecheir. Over 4 arouras of the vineyard, from which annually the produce [at the amount of 33 keramia of the new wine] is taken.  Summoned through Pelops the attendant, the 23rd year,  the 13th of Mecheir. (2nd hand) How is it possible, with the summons [l. 10] taking place on the 13th, on the day on which I took the letter from the praktor to the epistate of Philadelphia, to make an appeal for renewal of the action immediately on that same day in Krokodilopolis, [l. 15] while I was that far from the polis on that day.  Even if somebody tried to come to the polis, he would not catch the chrematistai still sitting, which would be most frustrating.  I took the letter from the epistate to [l. 20] the praktor on the 14th, and on the 15th I appealed to the chrematistai through Demetrios the attendant.</ab>
