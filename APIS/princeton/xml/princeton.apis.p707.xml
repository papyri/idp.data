            <ab>. . . I have registered in the passed first year at the same village full-grown sheep 15, lambs 10, goats 3; the total from the previous year to the current [l. 5] year: full-grown sheep 25, goats 3, of which the loss in accordance with register and count was for the current year full-grown sheep 10.  This leaves full-grown sheep 15, goats 3 [[which I have registered]], [l. 10] and following the birth in the first year of 10 lambs, the total is [[25]], which totals for the second year at the same village, 25 sheep.  Of these in the same first year in the same village there was a loss of 10 new born lambs.  The sheep will remain at the same village and in the grazing area of the shepherd Ammonios.  And I swear by the fate of [l. 15] Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Pius Felix Augustus not to have lied.  The 2nd year of Emperor Caesar [l. 20] Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Pius Felix Augustus, I swear by his fate not to have lied. The 2nd year of Emperor Caesar Marcus Aurelius [l. 25] Antoninus Pius Felix Augustus, 5th of Mecheir.  Aurelius Ammonius Ptolatos through me . . . I have given and sworn the oath as appropriate.</ab>
