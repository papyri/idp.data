                  <summary>Letter from Theodoulos to Eulogios in which Theodoulos takes Eulogios to task on his failure to deliver some hemp for which he has been waiting for two months and requests that delivery be made to Kalokairos and Paniskos whom he names as agents.  The name of Paniskos has been added as an interlinear addition by a second hand).  He reminds Eulogios that the hemp belongs not to him (Theodoulos), but to his master.  He also suggests alternatively that the money value of the hemp might be paid</summary>

            <ab>To my father and lord Eulogios, Theodoulos sends greetings.  Another time when I came [l. 5] to you along with my brother Nikon for Euantheia and for hemp, which [l. 10] you owe me, you then asked me to allow you to wait for a few days until [l. 15] we meet and you return the hemp.  I am astonished since two months have passed as of today and you did not return the hemp to me.  For you should know that it is not [l. 20] mine, but belongs to my master.  I have asked therefore that you deliver the hemp to my brother Kolokairos [added in diff. hand] and Painiskos.  I pray you be well for [l. 25] all time.  Or, you can give to them the price value of the hemp.</ab>
