I wish to lease from you the five arouras which belong to you near the village of Argias from a katoikic allotment and the two arouras which belong to you near the village of Apias from a katoikic allotment, all being (held) in common and undivided from the fourteen arouras or however many there may be, the rent as a whole for all the arouras being fourteen artabas free from every tax, the artaba tax for all the arouras being paid by me, Ptolemaios (as well). And I shall perform all the proper agricultural work [at my expense] . . .   And [I shall pay] the rent [in the month of Pauni (?) . . .] on the threshing floor [in the village(?)] . . . [with a four-choinix measure, (the payment in kind being) new,] clean, and pure.  And after the term, [I will return to you the] plot clean of rush and [reed and] every [filth] . . . (2 H.) Year 13 (?) of Antoninus Caesar the Lord [month, day].
