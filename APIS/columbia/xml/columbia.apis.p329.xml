                  <summary>Receipts addressed to the state bank of Sabinos and Company by guards and transport men, which were pasted together into a continuous roll. They record 3 types of service: land transport of public grain; water transport; wages paid to policemen and tower-guards</summary>
                  <msItem>
                     <note type="general">Written along the fibers; on the back P.Col. V 1 verso 4</note>
                     <note type="general">The receipts are written by many different hands; the hand of col. 2 seems to be the same as that of Herakleides, the secretary of the tower guards: a sprawling and difficult handwriting</note>
                     <note type="general">The receipts are in chronological order, with one exception</note>
                     <note type="general">All the 19 receipts follow a common form; they are in memorandum form</note>
                     <note type="general">In most of the receipts it is said that the payment was authorized by the royal scribe Ptolemaios who represented the strategos</note>
                     <note type="general">There is only 1 skipper receipt which shows an increase in legal requirements of documentation</note>
                     <note type="general">The guards received different payments for no apparent reason; their ages were between 20 and 45, with the exception of one 57 years old; they were all illiterate and a private notary Herakleides, signed for them</note>
