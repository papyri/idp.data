            <ab>Apollonios to his brother, greeting. I sent Menodoros to bring you a letter (stating) how many jars there are among the possessions of Sostratos. Thereafter we found two belonging to him in a certain empty outhouse. As it now stands, none of these are broken. I enumerate below now also how many there are in the storerooms. In the portico, in the corner, 1. Others, lying next to the same, 7 half-Chia, 3 keramia. Next, 6 banotoi. Of Egyptian make, 11. In the first storeroom, to the left as one goes in, in the corner, 11. Further in, on the right, 18; on the left, 8. In the second room, 24, and 1 Chian jar. In the inmost room 8 keramia, 5 of sour wine, I Chian jar. In the small portico, 5 Chian jars. Good-by. Chilon stated that he could not come to you. For his servant was occupied with them (i.e., the jars), he said. I will send another servant to you, whomever you wish.     [Verso:] To Zenon.</ab>
