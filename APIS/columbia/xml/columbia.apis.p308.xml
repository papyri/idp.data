            <ab>After the advocate Didymos the younger had replied that the soldier was not harmed by that which had been read, and that he was not disinherited, but that his individual share had been disposed in accordance with a will which his mother had made, the strategos [said], "The will cannot at all harm the soldier, but he ought to inherit in accordance with the edicts read and introduced by him."
