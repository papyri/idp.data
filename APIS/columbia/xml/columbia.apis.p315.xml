            <ab>(Front) Cornelius to Theon, his dear friend, greeting. Since not only the secretary but also everyone else has given instructions for the distributions of the wine which you manage, of which I submitted accounts for Tybi and Mecheir, and which were distributed by me to the vinedressers, to be given to me, on the grounds that they are owed by you--I instruct you as a matter of urgency, my friend, in order that you may know and be forewarned, in order to avoid incurring any penalty . . .
