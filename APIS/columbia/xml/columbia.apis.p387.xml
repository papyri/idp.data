            <ab>Lucius Bellenus Gemellus to his own Epagathos, greetings. When you receive my letter, please have the manure heaped up in order that you may make the store place which you mention, and dig a deep trench around the oilpress outside in order that access to the winepress may not be easy, and remove the manure to the manure pile, and let them flood all our fields in order that the sheep may be folded there, and let them irrigate the oliveyards for the second time, and go over to Dionysias and find out whether the oliveyard has been watered twice and dug; and if not, let it be watered . . . and give to . . . and Psellos, the sitologoi . . . and Chairas, the scribe of the cultivators, and to Heraklas ninety drachmas and interest, and to Chairas, the former tax collector, 24 drachmas, and Didas . . . the price of the barley, 240 drachmas and interest, and to Heron, the former president (?), two years</ab>
