                     <note type="general">The papyrus had originally some imperfections, which explains the spacing between some letters</note>
                     <note type="general">The decisions were posted on March 14, 200 AD</note>
                     <note type="general">The original document represented in lines 22-24 was written in Latin</note>
                     <note type="general">Perhaps the transcript was made for official purposes; it is possible, however, that it was a memorandum made by a notary for his own use</note>
                     <note type="general">The body of the text was written by a capable professional scribe with many ligatures; the copyist did not take down the names and titles of the two Augusti, and a second scribe crowded them in later on in small letters</note>
