            <ab>(I pray you) to send me very quickly the coat. You know that it is winter and they are needed. Do not neglect this and, if you have any need of things from here let me know by letter so that I may send them to you, knowing that it is a pleasure for me to do this; or you will give the things (I need) to my brother. I have enjoined him not to neglect this matter. You too know the man who owes me (money), since it would not be right to name him by letter, and please also do as much (as you can), for I know that you love me, in order to bother him, since he is careless. If you obtain anything, you will write back to me. I greet your daughter and your son. Horigenes, Pasis, and Protous greet you. Be well.
Reverse: Deliver it to Nemesianos.
