            <ab>In the consulate of our masters Constantinus Augustus for the seventh time and Constantius the most illustrious Caesar for the first time, to Flavius Dionysios, former centurion of the staff of the rationalis, from Aurelius Stephanos son of Euporos, former archon, councillor of the glorious and most glorious city of the Oxyrhynchites, greeting. I acknowledge that I have received and have had measured out from you, on loan, from your house, ninety (90) artabas of wheat, the principal including the additional half, (measured) by the tenth measure, which wheat new, clean, without dirt or barley, sifted, using the measure with which I received it, at the place where I had it measured out to me, I shall perforce repay you without delay or excuse in the month of Epeiph of the present year 21 and 11 and 3. If not, I shall pay you a penalty at the rate of fifty percent on each artaba for the excess time, and you retain the right of execution on me and all of my possessions of whatever kind.  This contract, written in duplicate, is normative wherever it may be produced and for whoever produces it on your behalf. After having been questioned, I consented. During the aforesaid consulate, Thoth 22.
