            <ab>Following the consulship of the most illustrious Flavius Belisarius; Phaophi 10, first indiction.  To the most admirable Apollos, son of Dioscorus, son of Psimanobet, syntelestes from the village of Aphrodito in the Antaeopolite nome, from Aurelius Psaeus, son of Phunsius, son of Salatocus, from the same village in the same nome. Greetings. I acknowledge willingly and of my own choice to have leased from your virtuousness for a period of five years, counting inclusively from the crops, God willing, of the coming second indiction, the unirrigated aruras which belong to you and are called √¢¬Ä¬úthe aruras of Casillas,√¢¬Ä¬ù on the farm of Thinestme, to the west of the road and to the north my own aruras, on condition that I provide for the land which I will be able to cultivate, whether inundated or uninundated, for each arura in accordance with a survey by the schoinion, 2 artabs wheat by your tax measure and without dispute.  The lease is authoritative and firm, and having been questioned, I agreed.  I the above-mentioned Aurelius Psaeus, son of Phunsius, have drawn up the lease in the way set out above.  I, Flavius Theotecnus, son of Psaeus, the former praepositus have written for him who does not know letters. Through me, Cyrus the notary, this has been written according to the will of god. (Verso) Lease of Psaeus, the aruras of Casillas.</ab>
