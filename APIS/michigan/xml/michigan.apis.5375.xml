                  <summary>There are several reasons to make us think that this papyrus may be a school exercise: the width of the letters is irregular (see note to v. 513); the accents are pronounced; there is an error of dative singular for dual nominative (v. 509); the text begins at the top of a piece of papyrus; an contains a very famous scene (Achilles and Priam weep together).;The small amount of text that pre sents no variant readings.</summary>

The papyrus is broken off on all sides. The top margin, which has suffered damage on the left and right edges (at its widest it measures 1.3 cm), contains tiny traces of stray ink. The back is blank.</ab>

                  <handDesc>
                     <p>The hand is an informal, rounded, and medium-sized one (see Turner ���Parsons, GMAW, p. 21); the letter height averages 0.5 cm. it is roughly bilinear; only phi projects a little bellow and above the line and rho below the line. There are no ligatures and the letters are formed separately. The hand is characterized by the uneven size and the differences in inclination of different but also of the same letters; for inconsistencies in size, see e.g. alpha and omicron, and for the inclination pi and epsilon. Also, the spacing between the letters is not always the same. Sometimes the mid-stroke of epsilon curves upwards and its upper horizontal is formed with a separate additional stroke. mu is made deep. Omega���s left and right strokes are almost vertical and slightly curved and its central hasta is almost is almost non-existent. Pi is made in two separate movements of the pen, of which the first forms the left-hand vertical and the second produces the horizontal and the other vertical stroke in a single flowing line. Alpha���s circle is sometimes enlarged. Theta���s horizontal bar slightly extends to both sides.;Two acute accents are visible in the first two lines (vv. 507-8) of the column, as the surviving portion of the text shows. Both are drawn as long oblique strokes. There are two corrections in this text: in v. 507, on the left above the epsilon in eim[eron (an iotacistic mistake for im[eron) there is a dot; in v. 510 the first preserved letter of the line, iota, is stricken through with an oblique slant and two dots are written, one above and one below it. In the second instance, a dative and written an iota adscript. The ink of both the accents and the corrections looks a little darker than the text, so we can assume that these elements were inserted later either by the same or by a different hand; for the way the corrections were noted see Turner _ Parsons, GMAW, p.16.;The fragment preserves forms of only sixteen characters of the alphabet, and these provide no reliable basis for dating the hand. Judging mainly from the way the letters epsilon and pi are drawn (see above) the hand could be dated in the first or (more likely) second centuries A.D. Similar features of these letters can be traced in Turner _ Parsons, GMAW, no 17 (II A.D.); cf. epsilon in v. 25 and pi throughout; cf. also Schubart, PGB 20 (I/II A.D.)</p>
