            <ab>In the name of Allah the Merciful, the Compassionate.;This is what Sar»Ìh son of Daniyal bought from Baq»Ìm son of Damiyani, from among the residents of Tut»¶n in the District of the Fayy»¶m.;He bought from him the house which belongs to him, east of the residence of Sar»Ìh son of Daniyal, with its boundary and its boundaries, and below it and above it,;And inside it and outside of it. The southern boundary is the residence of the heirs of M»¶nah the Deaf. Its northern boundary is the house which;belongs to Baq»Ìm son of Damiyani, Its eastern boundary is the residence of the heirs of Kayl son of Abam»Ìlah. Its western boundary is the residence of Sar»Ì√° son of;Daniyal. He bought that from him for two dinars and a sixth minted gold of full, new and weight. Baq»Ìm;Son of Damiyani has taken (lit. Ç«£with the handsÇ«•) the price without any demand and in full. And he delivered;that to Sar»Ìh son of Daniyal. He took it, and he took possession of it, and he took ownership of it, and that has become part of his property,;possessed out of his right of possession. If he wishes he may sell, and if he wishes he may build, and if he wishes he may reside.

And whatever there may be by way of a claim for an attachment to the property, or;claims for a right in, or due from, the property, or should someone come adventitiously because of a loan, the execution of that and its clearance will be the obligation of Baq»Ìm son of Damiyani for the worth to which it amounts, out of;his clear property. Testimony was given to the affirmation of Baq»Ìm son of Damiyani to all that is in this document, after it was read;to him in Arabic and explained to him in the foreign language, being of sound mind and body and his actions legal, being willing,;without being averse, not being compelled, not being treated unjustly, being the petitioner and the one desiring. And that is in Muharram of the year;two and fifty and three hundred.
