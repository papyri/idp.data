                           <ab type="conservation">Dark brown papyrus of mediocre quality; broken off at all sides; badly damaged at bottom to left and right, and at left to top; a big portion is lost at the bottom to right. There is kollesis at ca. 6.5 cm from the left edge on recto and ca. 5 cm from the right side on verso. There are some damages also at some parts as a result of some irregular folds. Most of the text is partly washed out on recto and some words are partly washed out on verso.</ab>

                     <p>Recto is written along the fibers; the text consists of, at least, two columns; first column is written in medium-sized cursive and used very thick nib, and dipped the pen into the ink well frequently which made the letters are very bold and even hard to read; second column is written in small-sized cursive letters with fine pen; the hand is experient; the scribe has canceled line 10 by crossing out it with horizontal stroke. Verso is written across the fibers with two different hands, first hand is practiced, medium-sized and irregularly dipped the pen into the inkwell; second hand is elegant of medium-sized and used relatively thin nib.</p>
