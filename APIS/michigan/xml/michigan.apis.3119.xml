                  <summary>Side 1 contains a column of 21 proper names on the left side and two drawings on the right side. The first drawing represents a head with spiky hair. The second depicts a whole stick figure with large round eyes and a body covered by the same short strokes that are used to represent the hair on the head. Side 2 contains a mathematical exercise.</summary>

                     <p>Ink badly faded on side 1. The writing suggests a date from the Vth or the VIth century. Some of the letters, such as the v-shaped upsilon or mu  with a broad middle curve, can be compared to the Pindar codex, P. Oxy. XIII 1614 of the Vth or VIth century A.D. ?, cf. Turner, Greek Manuscripts of the Ancient World , London 1987, 2nd ed., 52,23; cf. also G. Cavallo and H. Maehler, Greek Bookhands of the Early Byzantine Period, London 1987, 48, 20b. The list of names on side 1 is followed by another name that was separated from the rest by a top and a bottom paragraphos or quasi-paragrahos, probably to mark the name of the student who wrote the exercise.;On this side another student wrote parallel to the longer sides of the tablet and left more than half of the surface blank on the right. When he used this side, the bottom left corner of the tablet was already broken off, as is shown by the grouping of the numbers with the first two columns shorter than the other two. Horizontal superlineations were drawn to show that these were numerals. The superlineations, in fact, start on top of the numbers of the first three columns. They are not present in the fourth column because for numbers 1,000 and higher a short bottom stroke was traced to the left of each.;The student who wrote on side 2 of the tablet is not the same as the one who wrote on the other side. There is a considerable difference in the writing capacities of these two students. The writer of the list of names is not merely a beginner practicing with letter shapes but is capable of tracing confident letters that are sometimes ligatured. He has a "rapid" hand that degenerates a little toward the bottom. He had certainly been exposed to much writing in order to improve his hand before he reached his level. By contrast, the writer of side 2 is a real beginner and shows an "alphabetic" hand with letters strikingly different in size and shape. It should be noted that it is not unusual for different students to work on the same tablet, since it is llikely that tablets used in class did not belong to individual students but to their teachers.</p>
