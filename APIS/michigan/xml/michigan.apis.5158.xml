                  <summary>Letter from N»Ìjid b. Muslim to √¨Abd All»Ìh b. As√¨ad with detailed instructions on how to collect the tax on agricultural produce (dariba, thaman). N»Ìjid writes that the amir has informed him of the total to be paid by the pagarchy, and how much that comes down to per village in N»ÌjidÇ«÷s calculation. He asks √¨Abd All»Ìh to divide the taxes among the individual (solvent) men of the villages and to inform them of how much they have to pay of wheat and clover. He finally instructs him to have his k»Ìtib help him in the execution of his task. ;All of the following nos are addressed to the same recipient: P.Mich.Inv. 5558(1); 5629; 5627; 5578(1); 5558(2); 5578(2); 5578(3); 5578(4); 5578(5); 5578(7); 5578(6); 5610; 5613(B); 5625 (A); 5620; 5619; 5613(A); 5632; 5578(9); 5622; 5609; 5621; 5623; 5625(1); 2526(B); 5631; 5578(8).</summary>
