            <ab>And seeing him they improvised the following line:;       all that we caught, we left; all that we did not catch, we bore away.;Not being able to understand what was said, he asked them what they meant. And they said that they had gone fishing and had caught nothing, and then they had sat down and hunted for lice. The lice which they caught they left there, but what they did not catch they carried away in their clothing. Recalling the prophecy that the end of his life was at hand, he composed this epigram to himself:;       The earth enveileth here his sacred head,;       The godlike bard who men and heroes led, Homer.;And as he withdrew he slipped because of the mud and falling on his side so met his end, they say. In regard to this, then, we shall bring to pass that we win distinction for ourselves, especially since we see that the historians are regarded with wonder. For this, then, Homer has been honored by all men both in his life and death. Let us then thank him thus for his playful entertainment; and as for his origin and the rest of his poetry, let us hand them down through - - - of memory for the common possession of the Hellenes, to those who wish to indulge their love of the beautiful.;;    ALKIDAMAS';      ON HOMER.</ab>
