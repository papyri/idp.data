                  <summary>Main text: Copy of a declaration on oath addressed to the governor of a public prison by a surety for a man who had been arrested for debt.  Theon, the surety, had secured the temporary release of the prisoner, Sarapion, some months previously; and now he undertakes to produce Sarapion within a month or to pay the amount of the debt. (Grenfell &amp; Hunt) Secondary text: The declaration is followed by a short and rather obscure letter written by Theon, and beginning apparently with a message to Sarapion.  Theon's object doubtless was to bring to Sarapion's notice the conditions of his bond on Sarapion's behalf. (Grenfell &amp; Hunt)</summary>

            <ab>Copy of a bond. Theon, son of Ammonius, a Persian of the Epigone, to Demetrius, governor of the prison of Zeus. I swear by Tiberius Caesar Novus Augustus Imperator, that I have thirty days in which to restore to you the man whom I bailed out of the public prison in Phaophi of the present year, Sarapion, son of Sarapion, arrested through Billus, assistant to the dioecetes, on account of a note of hand for a gold bracelet weighing two minae to Magianus on behalf of Aline, citizen, daughter of Dionysius. If I do not produce him within the said number of days, I will pay the said two minae of gold without delay, and I have no power to obtain a further period of time nor to transfer myself to another prison If I swear truly, may it be well with me, but if falsely, the reverse. 9th year of Tiberius Caesar Augustus, Pachon 22.
