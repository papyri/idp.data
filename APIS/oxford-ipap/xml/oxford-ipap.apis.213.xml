                  <summary>This deed preserves several specific terms: asphaleia (12), suggraphä (36), opheilä (38): but it is quite difficult to determine its precise nature. It seems to be a land-rental agreement disguised under the form of borrowing. Psais, son of Besios and of Tasais, deacon of Aphrodito, has rented from Dioscoros, protocometes of the same village, a piece of land of one aroura, for which he will pay the rent (phoros) in money. Moreover the proprietor has supplied the seeds - flax - and it seems also that the irrigation of the land is guaranteed by him - by means of his 'saqiah', situated in a nearby field. Psais undertakes to pay off as his rent-dues, and as the price of the seed and the irrigation, the sum of 1 nomisma less 2 keratia. Finally, the tenant will not take effective possession of the land until the time of sowing of the 12th indiction, which will not prevent him paying the rent at the end of the 11th, consequently one year before the harvesting. A similar transaction, although drawn up in a different form, appears in 67116. The subscription on the verso is in two lines. Belongs to the archive of Dioscoros.</summary>
