                  <summary>Drafts: (a) A Petition to Apollonios from Theopropos, who calls himself a theüros from Kalynda in Caria, stating that his farmer Theron had obtained from that city a contract for supplying the wine used at the annual festival in Kypranda.  Actually the wine was supplied on behalf of Theron by Theopropos himself, who had to borrow money to purchase it, and the sum due from the city for the supply of wine came to 850 drachmae. The city treasurers, Diophantos and Akrisios, had repaid 600 drachmae of this amount, but declined to pay the remaining 250 because the subscriptions had not all been paid up. Theopropos therefore asks Apollonios to write to the city and to the strategos and the oikonomos to see that the 250 are repaid. (b) A letter from Neon, another citizen of Kalynda, asking Damonikos to speak to Zenon on his behalf. Neon's father Therarchos, by an order from Alexandria, had been released from the obligation of providing quarters for soldiers or other employees of the State, as well as hay and pasture for the cavalry. When Therarchos died, the burden was reimposed upon Neon, who now asks for a new exemption to be written under his own name. (c) A draft of a memorandum on the same subject from Zenon, in which he mentions that Therarchos had married an aunt of his. He asks Apollonios to write again to Diodotos the oikonomos, the boule and the popular assembly, in order that Neon may enjoy the same privilege as his father. (d) A note about a letter to be written to a certain person, asking him to return a mare which he had borrowed, along with the little mule which she had foaled in the meantime.</summary>
