                  <summary>Pyrrhos complains that from the time when Hermon sailed down the river he has received no allowance of money, corn or oil.  When he was planning to sail down to Zenon and had no provision for the journey, his mother was obliged to pawn a himation for 1 1/2 drachmae and Iason could scarcely be persuaded to give him 12 drachmae in Kerke. He asks Zenon therefore to order the arrears to be paid and the allowances to be given regularly in future and to see also that he receives the clothing allowance; and he promises that his conduct will be irreproachable. His mother also ought to be considered, as she too has received no salary for the last fourteen months. Finally he asks Zenon to order Iason to give them the hut of Apollodoros the late head of the smithy and also five rafters of seven cubits.</summary>
