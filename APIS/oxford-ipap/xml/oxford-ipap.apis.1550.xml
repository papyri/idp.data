                  <summary>A short summary of the details of a judicial suit, but owing to lacunae and the involved construction the situation is not easy to grasp.  The text, according to a common custom at this period is given in duplicate, but there is a gap in the middle, and unfortunately the commencement is defective in both copies. Thrason and Pasis, the parties in the case, seem each to have accused the other of having lost 7 jars of wine from a store-place which had been leased by the owner Pasis. Affidavits were entered on both sides, and evidence was given that the store had been opened. The nature of the judgement, if indeed a judgement is recorded by the papyrus at all, depends upon the view taken of a mutilated passage, but there is reason to think that Pasis was condemned to pay compensation to Thrason to the extent of 56 drachmae.</summary>
