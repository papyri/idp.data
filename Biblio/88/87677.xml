   <note resp="#BP">The church complex is located at the centre of the settlement and testifies to a relatively large Christian community that lived at 窶連in el-Gedida (a few kilometers to the north-west of Kellis) by the first half of the fourth century CE. The entire site appears to have been abandoned toward the end of the same century.</note>
