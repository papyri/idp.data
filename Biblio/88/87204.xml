   <note resp="#BP">While states on the Red Sea and Indian Ocean rim in the ancient period were primarily inland states, maritime long-distance exchange facilitated by the monsoon winds brought these societies, separated by huge stretches of water, into close commercial contact over a period of centuries. Our main historical source to this trade, the Periplus of the Erythrean Sea, reveals a picture of inland states which took an active interest in maritime trade. Argues that maritime trade as an agent of change in Red Sea and Indian Ocean societies is reflected in the consistent use of terminology describing hierarchies of settlements in the Periplus.</note>
