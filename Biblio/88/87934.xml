   <note resp="#BP">In 2000, excavations were undertaken in Marea by a Polish Archaeological Mission. In the course of the following ten field campaigns, the team has fully cleared Byzantine baths of the 5th to 7th century connected with a well that supplied it with water and a funerary chapel. The present focus is on the exploration of a huge Christian basilica standing on the promontory above the port. Surprisingly, none of the ancient written sources carried a mention of this church which was the second largest building of its type in Egypt (after Abu Mena). Short history of the site, description of the church as well as architectural details found during the excavations in the basilica. - Avec résumés en anglais et en polonais.</note>
