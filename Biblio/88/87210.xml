   <note resp="#BP">The term Ichthyophagii (fish-eaters), was used by Greek and Roman writers to describe a number of discrete communities that shared a common coastal fishing economy along the Erythraean Sea coast, since the fifth century BC (Herodotus, 3.19 referring to events in 525 BC). One such group, Ptolemy's Arabaegypti Ichthyophagi, inhabited the coastal region of the Northern Red Sea and are the focus of this paper. Using new archaeological information it is possible to illustrate how Ichthyophagi identity was constructed and maintained alongside Desert, Nile and Mediterranean communities at the port site of Myos Hormos.</note>
