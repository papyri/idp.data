   <note resp="#BP">Trade in the Red Sea in Late Antiquity appears very different from the previous Roman period. This can be seen most clearly with the rise of Clysma and Aila at the extreme north of the Red Sea and the abandonment of Myos Hormos, Leuke Kome, and by the midfifth century, Berenice. Argues that the 'perceived' threat to merchant's security by nomadic groups along the eastern frontier (Saracens) and in the eastern desert (Blemmyes / Eastern Desert Dwellers) lead to the shift of Roman trade routes to easier defended ports such as Aila and Clysma.</note>
