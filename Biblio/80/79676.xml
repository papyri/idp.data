  <note resp="#BP">When the letter written by Dionysius of Alexandria to Novatian (and quoted by EUSEBIUS, Historia ecclesiastica VI, 45) is compared to other third-century letters from Egypt written on papyrus it becomes evident that it shares a number of similarities in terms of its length, format and epistolary style. Suggests that Eusebius has faithfully transcribed this letter and that it is a genuine copy of Dionysius' original letter to Novatian.</note>
