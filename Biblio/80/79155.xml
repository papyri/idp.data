   <note resp="#BP">Polish-Egyptian Mission, Tell Farama (ancient Pelusium). The work of the first two seasons (2004, 2005) brought to light remains of a theatre, apparently of the 2nd century AD, situated in the south part of the tell. In the third season (2006), the mission excavated the remains of a private house lying to the north-east of the theatre. The house was most probably built in the 4th century AD. One of the rooms of the house had a floor decorated with a mosaic with geometric and figural patterns, including birds. In the levelling layer of the mosaic, among the material prior to the 4th century AD, an interesting epigraphic find was made. It is a fragment of a limestone slab or plaque inscribed on both faces.</note>
