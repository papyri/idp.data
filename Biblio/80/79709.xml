  <note resp="#BP">Based on a chapter of the author's Oxford dissertation. - Throughout his production, Menander seems to have a firm grasp of the overall structure of his play, but also shows a remarkable eye for details, whether of staging, characterization of individual dramatis personae, or of implicit communication with the audience by hinting at various levels of, and problems with, 'realism', plausibility and motivation within a comic play. Aspis, with its neat construction full of mirror scenes, parallel behaviour patterns and unmistakable dramatic statements on the art of creating a drama, shows that New Comedy is an intelligent art form that - in order to pretend to imitate life - does not shun imitating art, tragedy just as other comedies as well.</note>
