   <note resp="#BP">Revised transcript (diplomatic and edited) of P. Princ. Inv. AM87-59A edited by Bruce H. KRAUT as P. Paramone 1 (second century BC). - Considering recto and verso together. - Tentative conclusions. The recto fragment gives the remains of comic trimeters, concerned in some way with a dinner and with kinship. The verso presents us probably with prose but possibly with more comic iambics, and seems to relate an anecdote about the poet Simonides. The two fragments remain fairly mysterious and should be considered independently of one another.</note>
