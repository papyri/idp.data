   <note resp="#BP">Research on archaeologically attested cordage is still in its infancy and terminology has been largely adapted from basketry and textile studies, resulting in much confusion and various ways of describing the different aspects of cordage. The present paper discusses this terminology and proposes changes as well as new terms on the basis of research on more than 9,000 cordage objects from eight years of excavations at Berenike (Egyptian Red Sea coast).</note>
