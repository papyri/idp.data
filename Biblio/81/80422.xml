  <note resp="#BP">Consider a supposed semantic development of the Greek term for 'gravedigger' in Hellenistic and Roman papyri: νεκροτάφος. Festugière, in his translation of the Historia Monachorum (ch. 10), suggested the word might mean 'grave-robber'. Festugière himself entertained doubts as to whether the translation was adequate because he knew no other evidence than the one in question. The authors agree that a gravedigger might be tempted to rob the dead bodies or grave furnishings with which he was entrusted or even to try to open existing graves in order to steal objects, but this does not justify the conclusion that νεκροτάφος did have a lexicalized second meaning 'grave-robber'. There is, however, a slight chance that this meaning became attached to νεκροτάφος with an ironic connotation.</note>
