  <note resp="#BP">Differs on some points from the most recent work: (i) The countryside in the southern Thebaid was not under Ptolemaic control before the final battle (close to Thebes) (contra Pestman); - (ii) Rebel hostility towards Egyptian religion seems to be Ptolemaic propaganda, and the Ptolemies had apparently lost control of the Nile in 195 BC (contra McGing); - (iii) Ethnic conflict was a significant factor in the 206-185 revolt (contra Veïsse).</note>
