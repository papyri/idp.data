  <note resp="#BP">"References to the Aiakidai and their Asopid mother Aegina in the Aeginetan odes of Pindar reflect an ideology that matches the ideology reflected by references to the Asopids in the epic composition known as the Hesiodic Catalogue of Women. The ideology of the Catalogue can be traced back to Athens in the era of the Peisistratidae." - "From my point of view, the narrative of the Catalogue was performed in Athens as an organic continuation of the narrative of the Theogony. And the venue for such a performance, in my view, was the festival of the Panathenaia at Athens in the era of the Peisistratidae."</note>
