  <note resp="#BP">Edition, translation and comment of portions of P. Herc. 1570 (= LDAB 119281), including (1): a prose paraphrase of Empedocles B111 in col. VII 11-16; (2): another prose paraphrase of a dialogue on poverty (πενία) between two of the characters in Menander's Georgos, Gorgias and Kleainetos, in which Poverty was personified (as in Aristophanes' Plutus) and satirized as the tireless companion of the poor man's life (coll. XI 1-XII 15); (3): indications that Epicurus himself criticized this very passage of Menander's play and gave reasons why poverty is not so difficult to live with, in answer to some of Menander's claims (coll. XII 15-XIII). - See in part. pp. 132-137: A new scene from Menander's Georgos (?): P. Herc. 1570 XI 3-XII 15.</note>
