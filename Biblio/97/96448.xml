  <seg type="original" subtype="resume" resp="#BP">P. Ryl. I, 59 (= MP3 274; LDAB 718) is a small papyrus fragment found at Oxyrhynchus and full of interest for textual and paleographical reasons. First published by A.S. Hunt in 1911, it is written on both faces along the fibers. On the side that we can identify as recto (there are no κολλήσεις), we can read the opening sentence of Demosthenes' On the Crown, repeated six times. The text is written in a chancery style comparable to P. Berol. Inv. 11532 (209 d.C.), which reports a letter of Subatianus Aquila. On the verso Hunt read only traces. Thanks to a re-exam of this papyrus, an Homeric verse has been identified (Iliad 3, 130), in a script comparable with the chancery style during Adrian's reign. In conclusion, we have to acknowledge that these two chancery styles coexisted during the second century. The scribe who wrote these texts wanted to improve his mastery with elaborate and studied chancery calligraphies. It is notable that he did not use a document in this exercise, but a Demosthenic oration.</seg>
