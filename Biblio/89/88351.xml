   <note resp="#BP">Through a survey of the papyrological findings on ancient Greek comedies, including dramatic fragments of both known and unknown authorship, provides an overview on preservation and dissemination of the archaia in Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt. Papyri show that ancient Greek comedies were read at the higher levels of education and within scholarly contexts and that still in the 4th century AD many pieces, bound to be lost in the Byzantine tradition, were by then still known and transcribed.</note>
