   <note resp="#BP">The Ptolemaic colonisation in Asia Minor and in the Aegean had a few goals connected with the imperial policy of the dynasty. Apart from the strategic significance, which in the rivalry between the superpowers of the time and due to the vastness of the Ptolemaic empire was of critical importance, the settlements functioned as a means of control. In Ptolemy II's politics they additionally played a propaganda and religious role. They also constituted the proof of the power of the dynasty. - Avec résumé en anglais.</note>
