   <note resp="#BP">Very few panel paintings on wood with Christian subjects have survived from late antique Egypt. One of these paintings, a bust portrait of a monk, is now one of the treasures in the Coptic collection of The Newark Museum, Newark. The portrait is painted in tempera technique on a roughly sawn piece of wood, probably sycamore. In its present state, the panel is 29 cm high, 40.3 cm wide and 1 cm thick.</note>
