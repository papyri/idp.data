   <note resp="#BP">In Alexander's empire, during his lifetime and immediately afterwards, an imperial year-counting system was in use over the whole empire, with the most important exception being Egypt, where demotic documents were dated by Alexander's regnal years as pharaoh instead of his Macedonian regnal years. When Ptolemy decided to take the royal title, the Demotic documents started to count by the first year of king Ptolemy, while the Greek ones continued the count of his satrapal years.</note>
