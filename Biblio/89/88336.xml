   <note resp="#BP">Perseus was worshipped in the Near East and Egypt rather than in Greece. He was a god who was identified with different characters of Eastern mythologies. Two case studies are presented, namely that of Ascalon, where this hero was called Phanebalos and worshipped among the highest gods, and that of Egypt, where he was identified with a lion-headed god, who was supposed to have cut Medusa's head. - Avec résumé en anglais.</note>
