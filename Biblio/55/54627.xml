   <note resp="#BP">Col. II was already written and complete before the scribe began to write Col. I in the blank space which had been left at the beginning of the roll. There is clearly a change of hand in the middle of Col. I. The texts in Col. I are not the actual texts of the letters as despatched. They are in a kind of shorthand, with only the salient points and key words noted down.</note>
