   <note resp="#BP">In most instances roga (ῥογά) represented a disbursement of money, but, depending on the recipient's need, it could be in kind (e.g. food). Rzk (ῥουζικόν) represented a disbursement granted to Muslims as a theologically authorized entitlement. Imposed on non-Muslims, the disbursement could take the form of food, etc. However the term roga was used in place of rzk if the scribe, or the recipient of the requisition, was not sufficient familiar with the meaning of the Arabic word.</note>
