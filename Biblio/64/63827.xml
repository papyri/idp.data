   <note resp="#BP">P. Hever? (previously known as P. Se'elim Gr. 3). 99 or 109 CE. There is no apparent evidence that we are in the Jewish and Nabataean milieu with which we have become familiar through the Babatha Archive. There is even a remote possibility that Nahal Hever and the Judaean Desert are not the provenance of this particular papyrus.</note>
