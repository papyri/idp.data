   <note resp="#BP">Excavations during the past decade by the Supreme council of antiquities have uncovered a number of cemeteries belonging to the ancient city of Mut (Mothis in Greek), which was the capital of the Dakhleh Oasis. At one of these, Bir esh-Shaghala, these excavations have found several large mud-brick tombs which originally had pyramidal superstructures and subterranean burial chambers. The authors publish here, in advance of a full report on the site, the Greek and demotic texts found on and in two of the tombs. - Introduction (R.B.). - A. Tomb 5: 1. Incised Greek inscription over the door (R.B.); - 2. The demotic inscription over the door (G.V.). - B. Tomb 6 (R.Cr.): 1. Painted Greek inscription in white paint on the wall under the vault, at left from the door; - 2. Second painted Greek inscription, also in white paint on mud plaster, on the wall to the left of the door as seen from inside.</note>
