   <note resp="#BP">Towards the end of Ptolemy IV's reign (222-205/4 BC), the scribes in Egypt changed their method of account from one using (silver) obols and drachms to one using copper drachms and talents. About the same time, the monarch retired his big bronzes - what numismatists now call Series 3 to 5 (2) - and eventually replaced them with Series 6, a bronze coinage of much smaller weights and modules. - 1. Table of Coins in Series 6a and b. - 2. Table of Coins in Series 6c to 6e. - See in part. pp. 143-144: discusses the use of bronze drachms in U.P.Z. I, 77.</note>
