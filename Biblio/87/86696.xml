   <note resp="#BP">The interplay between the narrative and performance of Pindar's eighth Paean embeds it within the physical environment of Delphi, at the site of the Alcmaeonid temple for which it was composed. Whether performed within the space for which it was composed or existing there as an inscription, Paean 8 can be thought of as a type of site dance that transforms (and is transformed by) its physical setting. - Avec résumé en anglais.</note>
