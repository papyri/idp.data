   <note resp="#BP">This article provides evidence for the vitality of Egyptian naming traditions in the Roman period in the form of new 'hybrid' names, which incorporate foreign elements (mainly Greek and Latin) into traditional Egyptian names. A comprehensive overview of the names and their characteristics is provided, as well as an analysis of the context in which they appear. They were not limited to a 'purely' Egyptian milieu, suggesting an altogether more mixed society in Roman Egypt, as opposed to the Ptolemaic period. - Introduction. - I. Characteristics of Egyptian hybrid derivations. - II. Hybrid names in family contexts. - Conclusions.</note>
