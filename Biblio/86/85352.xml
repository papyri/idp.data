   <note resp="#BP">Scrap of papyrus found in 1980, possibly written during the short occupation of the place by the Roman soldiers in 22-21 BCE. One Homeric verse (Iliad V 31; cf. 455), written (at least) six times by the same hand. The papyrus presents a reading accepted by Zenodotos, as is testified by Scholia in Iliadem (Erbse) 5.31d. Not strictly a ""school exercise"", rather a model for writing down Homeric verse.</note>
