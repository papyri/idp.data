   <note resp="#BP">Examines the models classical historians and papyrologists use to study Greek and Egyptian identity during the period of Greek occupation of Egypt. Argues that the concept of race should be added to current models to allow historians of this period to situate certain performances within a larger colonial structure that continued to treat the categories of ""Greek"" and ""Egyptian"" as conceptually distinct and indeed representative of inverse positions of social power. - Avec résumé en anglais.</note>
