   <note resp="#BP">In 645-646, the Byzantines attempted to recover Alexandria which was first captured by the Arab army under 'Amr bn. al-Āṣ in 641-642. The two Arab conquests of Alexandria are somewhat confused in most sources and actually there is no analytical description of the Arab conquest of the whole Egypt in general in any of them. Special attention is given to the attitude of the various segments of the population of Alexandria and its surroundings towards the Byzantine invading army during the second Arab conquest. These different segments of the population appear in the Arabic sources with the vague terms Rūm and Qubá. Finally, the failure of the Byzantine military policy to undertake successful, long distance, sea born expeditions against the Arabs, in order to regain their lost territory, is stressed.</note>
