   <note resp="#BP">By assigning to the slave girl Habrotonon the part of responding to Pamphile's rape and acting out a hypothetical confrontation with her rapist, Menander offers an especially vivid articulation of the experience of rape; this articulation, in turn, raises the possibility that Athenians could conceptualize sexual assault as a traumatic bodily experience rather than (or as well as) an act of hubris whose chief victims were a rape victim's male kin.</note>
