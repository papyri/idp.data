   <note resp="#BP">Deals with a newly edited fragment, P. Oxy. LXXVI, 5072 (= LDAB 140276), going back to the turn of the 2nd to the 3rd century CE. It contains remains of three Jesus logia on its verso, and fragments of an exorcism. While this exorcism story shows clear parallels to all synoptic accounts of Jesus' exorcisms, it is very probably neither a harmonization of the synoptic accounts nor a redactionally revised version of only one account. It is, however, argued that it should be understood as a ""re-enactment"" of the idea that Jesus did miraculous exorcisms, a re-enactment at a time when written accounts of these stories were already extant, but neither available everywhere, nor as important as the stories told about Jesus orally.</note>
