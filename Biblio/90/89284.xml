   <note resp="#BP">In the closing lines of his Iamb 13, Callimachus, in typical engagement with the literary past, looks back to representations of practitioners of invective discourse both in and beyond early iambos. Through the mouth of the pedant who addresses him at the start, he provides what turns out to be no condemnation, but a celebratory account of the novel medley created here, one that successfully refines and palliates even as it preserves enough of the ancient invective spice.</note>
