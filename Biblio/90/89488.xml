   <note resp="#BP">Concerns a critical approach to Procopius' account of Diocletian and the measures which the latter took to secure the defense of the southern frontier of the Empire in Egypt. Examines the question of the administration of the Dodecaschoinos immediately before the Roman withdrawal until the first mention of the Nobadian state: How justified is Procopius when he refers to the Nobades as a tribe which played a role in the historical scene in the late 3rd century?</note>
