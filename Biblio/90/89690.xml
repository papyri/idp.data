   <note resp="#BP">Continued from: VDI 289 (2014, fasc. 2) pp. 3-12. - Alexander's names on the artifact are different from those found on his Egyptian monuments (the latter showing not more than three of them), their major theme being his world dominance. Argues that there are no indisputable reasons to date the artifact to the reign of Alexander; rather, it was erected under the early Ptolemies in order to show their succession to Alexander and to highlight his ""Egyptian mythology"" shaped around the famous episode in the Siwa Oasis. - Avec résumé en anglais.</note>
