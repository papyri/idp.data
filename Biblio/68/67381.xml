   <note resp="#BP">P. Petra Inv. 10 (to be published in the near future) contains a wealth of Semitic, for the most part Arabic, toponyms and names of houses and parts of houses written in Greek letters (sixth century). Thanks to a parallel in line 4 of P. Nessana III, 82, it was possible to recognize in line 150 of P. Petra Inv. 10 the first element of a toponym as being mal 'property'.</note>
