   <note resp="#BP">Fragments of P. lit. Lond. 132 (= Pack2 1233) have turned up in a collection in the library of St. John's College, Cambridge. Two of the largest were published as Bb II and III by Blass in the Teubner edition of 1869; Blass placed them both in the Oration against Demosthenes. The third appears not to have been published.</note>
