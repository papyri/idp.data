   <note resp="#BP">Both words clearly refer to the flax plant. λινοκαλάμη is a very serviceable word, as "flax" is in English, but why it did not gain currency beyond Egypt is open to speculation. ἀμοργίς has its own peculiarity. It seems to have been localized in Attica as kind of trade name for a flax that was woven into a fine linen fabric used in women's clothing.</note>
