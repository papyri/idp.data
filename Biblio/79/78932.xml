   <note resp="#BP">MS Paris copte 12920 transmits the Greek texts of three Eastertide hymns, two with Coptic translations. The first is a troped Trishagion, the second a responsory based on gospel and psalm texts, and the third a strophic alphabetic acrostic. These compositions illustrate ways in which the Greek language was still being used for religious literature in mediaeval Egypt even after it had ceased to be used for documentation.</note>
