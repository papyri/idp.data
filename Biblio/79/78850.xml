   <note resp="#BP">The conversion of the Alexandrian Tychaion into a tavern in ca. 391 C.E. implies that the temple's divine statues must have been removed or destroyed at the same time. This was part of an imperial programme intended to decommission certain high-profile pagan temples in a conspicuous, morally degrading fashion. As the Progymnasmata of Ps.-Nicolaus include as an ecphrasis an eyewitness description of the interior of the Tychaion, including the cult statues, it should be dated to the late fourth or early fifth centuries.</note>
