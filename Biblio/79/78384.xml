   <note resp="#BP">I. Introduction. - II. Segregative commensality. - III. Exceptional commensality. - IV. Transgressive commensality. V. Extra-domestic commensality. - VI. Conclusions. - Literary, epigraphic, and papyrological evidence from Graeco-Roman associations suggests that their meal practices were not limited to one particular type of commensality. Rather, a broad examination of the data demonstrates that associations undertook, at various times and places, segregative commensality, exceptional commensality, transgressive commensality, and, in some cases, "extra-domestic" commensality.</note>
